It was rather graphic and made for such a sad image seeing how anguished the skull looked and how much dirt got in between the bones and dirtied it, and for some time (maybe a few days, I'm not quite sure) I couldn't get that image out of head, I couldn't cope with seeing a real picture of a skeleton in my childhood because I saw that as my fate, to just be dumped in the dirt somewhere and left to anonymously rot (and I guess I'm still very averse to seeing like, casual depictions of human remains just strewn about just to illustrate edginess in fiction, it's something I also learned is taboo in Chinese culture so maybe that might tie into my unease at that, it also seemed callous and unfitting with how much we'd actually give due to the dead and go out of our way to ensure a proper disposal with them irl. Don't really care about what happens to my body after I die though, if it weren't for familial objections I'd be okay with having them shipped to a cadaver farm) complete with solemn, reflective background music from the SpongeBob series constantly overplaying to that image (some kinda guitar, leaning on not Hawaiian because of the notes, played slowly and repetitively, just the same guitar section repeating all over my head). That and reading about people who got lost in Everest expeditions with their bodies never found and presumed dead because they fell into a crevasse really fucked me up and left stark childhood impressions, the latter because since their bodies weren't found I always had this fear they would crash through the roof while I was showering for some reason, like a boogieman, but not like a zombie, all alive in their ice-covered climbing jackets and gear, even though everything I was reading happened 20+ years ago.","Lmao.

text: ["Does Sia not realise if she\u2019s conceding that it\u2019s a spectrum, that we are technically then all on it and saying that means she could\u2019ve had two non-autistic people advising her because they could\u2019ve been on the other extreme end of the spectrum. Woke spin literally never makes sense for an objective model.","All mental illness is varying shades of autism","dunno maybe it is that all of us have ADHD, I for sure have and I feel the same.\n\n(and its a real thing, like - overdiagnozed for sure but the moment I was for the first time having full control over my mental faculties was for the Gods)","how tf was this true for everyone but me.... like my doc made me cycle through antidepressants for a year before prescribing ritalin. unless you mean illegally lol","o I thought of that frosted ~~flakes~~ mini wheats autist","Reading through your comments, I can't tell if you're a troll or just autistic. Ya gotta work on your personality there dude, you come off as a piece of shit most of the time. I say that with kindness because if that's how you interact with people, you're gonna have a rough life ahead of you","It's the evil ultrawoke offspring of the toxic positivity movement. \"Thank you for your emotional labor in educating me, and giving me the opportunity to reflect and grow as an ally! I'm decentering my privilege to listen and hold space for your anger. You are valid.\"","Suit autists are the best.","it's not even that they throw the towel in the ring because of the symptoms of their mental illness, it's that they overexaggerate their mental illness as to excuse them for not having to take any responsibility and throwing the towel in the ring.","I\u2019m medically diagnosed as autistic and ADHD and my opinion is anybody who claims to have either of these but isn\u2019t medically diagnosed is lying.","\nADHD is serious and real, go fuck yourself","I hate the way zoomers and young millennials deal with mental health. Im 27 and was diagnosed with ADHD twice, once in England and once in Ireland. They found it out because I didn\u2019t start speaking till late and when I did, I had a speech impediment and talked really fast. Basically I sounded like a retard. What I was told was that it was my responsibility to fix that, which meant speech therapy and I had to catch myself. I wasn\u2019t just allowed to walk around rooms. I also have to make myself listen to what people say and think slowly about what they said. Nobody should make allowances for me just because Im odd, that\u2019s life. ADHD is not a big deal and is very manageable, you just need to learn to manage it. Its not bipolar. \nI started dating a girl and she found out I had ADHD and then went straight to her therapist and got diagnosed when she was 21. Cool, girls get diagnosed later in life, she can learn to cope. Instead she used it as this incredible excuse for all her shitty behaviour. She used to cry to me about how hard it is to have ADHD, like I was supposed to be sympathetic, shed get mad at me for being callous about it. She would go to her shitty doc to complain and get pills, he never taught her how to cope, just get more pills and bill her rich Dad. Mental health is not an excuse to fail. It can lead to you failing but ultimately, you need personal responsibility to manage yourself. I hate that its fetishized and self diagnosed as a way to be a cunt.","I have ADHD you retard","The amount of people I know who have been diagnosed with ADHD just to get addy is absurd. They just read symptoms online and told their therapist.","I agree to a point, I definitely know some zoomers who are aged 18-21 who claim to be autistic and queer as their whole personality. And they can't function in society at all or hold jobs or relationships. I only know people like this online, as I'm 27 and pretty far removed from that sort of person in my normal life. All my IRL friends are normal lol","You\u2019re alluding to a very uncomfortable point that people hate talking about when you said them/they usually = autistic","is it not empirically proven that adhd has a prevalent genetic component","Im in my 30s now, millennial. When I was a kid, about as young as 6 or 7, my teacher told my mom I likely have ADHD and to give me chocolate before bed . If I was able to go to sleep that meant I had ADHD. She later sent me to a therapist and psychiatrist for further testing. Eventually I was taking Ritalin by the time I was in 2nd grade. Spitting it out in the hall way after leaving the nurse's office because I didn't like how it made me feel.  The kid who had a lunchtime medication as well (we always went together) noticed and told on me one day so they started checking under my tongue. They'd change me to Adderall, Concerta.  Max out my dose on pretty much everyone by the time I was about 15.  Now I don't take anything and I am completely fine. I doubt I ever had any (major) ADD/ADHD.  I would have been better off just allowing myself to get absorbed into whatever I found cool that month, keep me occupied with lots of sports, music practice and other activities. It was the 90s but some kind of mindfulness would have probably helped a ton. I don't want to have any sort of disdain for therapy or psychiatry  because I know a lot of people really depend on them, but I don't personally trust them and if my child ends up getting suggested to need some sort of medical grade stimulant I probably won't be quick to get on board.","So many girl bosses get diagnosed and go overboard, acting like it\u2019s a real disability. Sorry that doing soul crushing work is boring. \n\nI had a GF who got diagnosed at 21, after finding out I had it. The difference between our experience with ADHD was totally different. Hers was she didn\u2019t like doing school and made it out like it was such a hard thing, finding school boring. She\u2019d cry about it\n\nThen there was mine where I didn\u2019t learn to really speak till I was older and had a really bad speech impediment. I used to not be able to sit down and even now it comes out in really spergy ways like me randomly running and verging on substance addiction. I took responsibility for it on me and just know it\u2019s nothing I can do. I\u2019ve always been this way. I think that\u2019s the difference between us, I\u2019ve always known I\u2019m odd so idk what it\u2019s like to be normal. She adopted the ADHD symptoms so she \u201cknows\u201d what it\u2019s like to be normal. I don\u2019t cry about it","Agreed 10000%. I was also diagnosed with OCD and have been working really hard to RECOVER!!! Dumbfounding to think about making something that makes me lash out at others, spiral into paranoia, and destroy opportunities an ~*identity*~. We are not helpless nor are we meant to live this way !","I spent 15 years running from my diagnosis. And now these people want nothing more than to be diagnosed.","My ADHD is so bad that I have literally gotten distracted during sex, I started thinking about random shit. There\u2019s a difference between, my work is boring and I watch Tik Tok instead for the dopamine, and I literally can\u2019t keep my attention on one thing even if it interests me.","In regards to your 3rd point, I just think back to my own diagnosis of ADD(when it was still officially referred to that when you weren't on any hyperactive end of things) when I was 10 or so and my brother would joke with stuff(mostly to make me feel better and not weird about it)  like 504  and other things on the books at that time in school that was afforded to me to get extension for test taking and other things and how \"now that the diagnosis is official, I can use that excuse for anything\". \n\nThe fucked up thing is how there's an entire wave of not only people taking that angle completely serious but having mass reinforcement that they deserve the world served up on platter because of their commitment to going on about any condition they have.\n\nI also agree with your general take away that people absolutely have no coping skills with things.","Wait,\u201dlong Covid\u201d is real but adhd and depression and autism isn\u2019t? Lmao","Eh I've never known anything else. For the record, autism isn't a mental ilness; it's a pervasive developmental disorder. I am mentally stable and succesful but I'll always be autistic. I'm not 'ill.' By the way I get 300 euro's supplemental income just for being an autistic student, suck it neuronormie. I also get to make exams with extra time and a laptop. Everything is easier when you're autistic, and here's the kicker: it's completely made up. I'm actually just a normal fucking weirdo.\n\nHumour is just a coping mechanism. This is not something we can 'overcome', so yes we make peace with it and feel proud for the way we manage to adjust to society in varying degrees. I can't imagine anyone on that sub actually thinks autists are superior. I don't visit it, I make fun of neuronormies to their face IRL.","It's not autism if the subject in question is genuinely fascinating to a lot of people","It's not atypical, these people are only being hyperbolic and using autistic as a word for 'very curious'.","unlike autists","I think it's a good take, but is there a common impression (I can't bring myself to use the word discourse) that female autists are particularly troubled or treated poorly?","Female autists like Anna and her considerably more autistic circle of she-tists on Twitter are in general suffer less from social deficits, which is why they don't get diagnosed in childhood and thrown into the system like true male autistics. Sensory processing deficits and disorders are much more pernicious amongst this set though, which is why these broads all need their right kind of fuzzy socks and blanket and shit and always need back rubs and shit","Anna wants autism paypigs","I don't think those people refused to help because they had autistic people on a moral pedestal. They probably just didn't want to involve themselves in something where they might be accused of mistreating either an 11 year old girl or an autistic 17 year old.","Didn\u2019t some study say that 28% of serial killers and mass murderers were autistic?","It\u2019s probably the same thing on the other end with the trans and autism relationship","I knew someone that was a diagnosed autist. He would sit in a corner and gurgle all day.","I am autistic and I hate women (and men)","meh little correlation to misanthropism and autism in particular","I hope no one actually thought an economics university dropout art critic turned pop culture and politics podcaster has any insights into autism","It's cool that people are using their neurodivergency to excuse being a piece of shit.","That's neurodivergent and nonsamesexattracted.","just graduated with a 4.0 and a humanities degree\n\nMy autism could be the confounding factor","this includes more than homeless and schizos, it's the autistic kid or extremely awkward nerd in class who always tries to befriend you too. they know you're nothing like them but for some reason they always gravitate towards you.","i feel like it must've been less bad being schizo in the old days. you probably just assume it's god and you're blessed, and most people around you feel the same","Lol sorry you completely lack empathy. My brother is autistic I understand.","love me a man with noticeable autism","Interesting. Im german and did an exchange to australia when I was younger and their takeaway basically was that they didnt like half of my german peers because they seemed like psychopaths. I think I was somewhat accepted because im just a sociopath.",">decompressing from his day\n\nis he autistic?","I wish I was this kind of pseudo-autistic. I\u2019m not passionately interested in anything and I don\u2019t know any subject in depth.","*asocial","[>autistic](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/650/747/aaf.png)\n\nat least rightoids are able to overlook my lack of charisma and dweebishness - and appreciate specific intellectualized portions of AS; I can't speak the same for most post-2012 lefties - who all too primarily act like perpetual 80's high school bully charicatures and petty mean girl types.\n\nand I most certainly can't vouch that I had the most stellar of experiences growing up around ghetto/lumpenprole types as a neurodivergent (clinically diagnosed in early grade school), a bisexual and a characteristically \"beta/nerdy\" type. fun fun.\n\nthese are the key ingredients to the development of some hefty C-PTSD demons.",">as a neurodivergent\n\nNever seen anyone use this term outside of r/fakedisordercringe\n\nDude, you need to get out of your own head and relax. A part of this sub tends to be nostalgia for mid 2000's through early-mid 2010s internet culture and humor.\n\nHe had some old tweets that made me chuckle; that's all. I yearn for the less corporate controlled and consolidated internet of old, even Twitter was a magnitude less insufferable.","The bell curve concept is autistic, but their specific rankings (e.g. Summer Glau as a 5.5 and Saoirse Ronan and Constance Wu as 5s) feels very psychopathic","\\*All\\* the autism.","Autistic by any chance?","I've met like ten RS people IRL. Marked social disfunction in all but one or two.","redwoods + fob chicks + both ends of the autism stick \u2014 couldn't be anywhere else","I haven\u2019t yet and still need to. I met some of the RSP discord users but I don\u2019t even have discord so it\u2019s not the same. But anyway one is a confident autist, another is a fake normie (like he Larps as a normie unconvincingly) so I can see where ur coming from","Let\u2019s see. A lot of traditional herbs in Europe were for reducing anxiety, and the plants were GABA agonists and serotonin reuptake inhibitors. These are essentially minor version\u2019s of today\u2019s pills. Chamomile, passionflower and lemon balm interact with GABA. Licorice, ginger interact with serotonin much like today\u2019s treatments. \n\nSaffron has been used for millennia and it has a remarkable effect on the brain similar to Ritalin. Studies have found it as successful as ADHD medication. Was used by ancient Greeks and Persians. Sadly the Western boycott on Iran/Afghanistan makes it prohibitively expensive (American Saffron is totally different plant).",">I have legitimate conditions, and I'm too dumb to seek help\n\nWhat is happening to them is a legitimate thing, but there is help for it.

It's actually a pretty sexy culture amongst the reasonably attractive participants, of which there are plenty if your standards are realistic. if, like me, you used to fap to monica lewinsky, or you're into aoc, you'll be fine with available local or low ranking political pussy in any leftist area.\n\nAs to the alternative to real life participation: you're looking at it! The online culture wars are real now, trump was memed into reality. Every shitpost we make can legitimately move the needle, more than ever before in history.","[obama]","\\[obama\\]","The thinner you are the less of yourself there is to hate","Great point. So much of their ideology is based in hypocrisy it\u2019s wild. I know we all have that, but I don\u2019t make my politics my entire identity, so it\u2019s less of a big deal. But I\u2019ve argued with people who in one breath talk about rape culture and how dangerous it is for a woman and then also say they don\u2019t think people belong in jail. Who do they think is in jail? Do they not understand how power and anti-social behaviors manifest? The filling of power vacuums in poor neighborhoods and how it\u2019s exercised yadda yadda yadda. \n\nThere was just that story about the guy in midtown Manhattan who randomly beat the shit out of the old Asian woman in broad daylight and people are shocked he\u2019s out of jail after stabbing his mother in front of his five year old sister less than 20 years ago. That\u2019s the more \u201cprogressive\u201d prison system that you\u2019ve been talking about for years. Do they really think every person in jail is some poor young black kid who just had a dimebag? Fucking smooth brains.\n\nEdit: stop clicking a button and actually argue if you have a problem with my point. Seriously.","After college, Obama worked at the \"[Business International Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_International_Corporation)\" for a year. Totally a legit sounding company... Turns out it has ties to the CIA.","if you search the phrase there's old threads about it iirc but it went from something a guest said in the context of fashion/art world cynically using climate diaster for drama with their brands->\"*we* didn't say that!!\"-> wait actually we think she was right->ummm climate change is fake and \\*\\*y or wait just kidding...we just mean neoliberal responses are bad or wait do we ;)","I havnt listened since Trump left office. Not as fun anymore","On the last episode they said they thought the DNC might screw Eric Adams out of the NYC mayoral race in favour of the AOC candidate lol","yeah and now Eric Adams is gonna be the mayor, hang tight nyc lol","really great summation of how I see most harm posting on twitter. Especially the main character of the universe bit.","In all seriousness liberalism mostly just hides racism and misogyny and it\u2019s better for everybody to let misogynists and racists individually let their freak flag fly, then to just shut them down.","Because it shows what people are thinking and therefore says something about a part of society","it honestly is the only moral centrist position these days","I genuinely can\u2019t tell whether you\u2019re a psyop or just a liberal. If it\u2019s the former tell your handler I said you deserve a raise tho","everyone is a liberal","i get they are contrarian pilled and stand for nothing but it's gross to put ur arm around a freak who harassed the grieving parents of massacred preschool children","i dont even like alex jones but the ppl here saying theyre evil for taking a pic with him are being melodramatic.","They stand against the disintegration of American society. What do you stand for? Cancel culture? Yeah, Jones\u2019 treatment of the Sandy Hook victims was a bit much, but he\u2019s paid a heavy price for his sins.\n\nShould Jones be persona non grata forever? Do you not believe in forgiveness? I think Jones is a total nutjob, but I wouldn\u2019t be opposed to hanging out on his ranch and picking his brain. \n\nDon\u2019t hate the player, hate the game!","\\>they're bigger morons than Anna and Dasha\n\nYeah a lot are. and some proportion will gravitate to his views, or not think he is batshit insane.  letting a charismatic personality like his run wild on your podcast does normalizes him. Its a step in his direction not the left's.","\\>people are becoming more extreme as conditions worsen despite what you think the TV should be and the ear buds should have on them\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I should disregard basic morals standards for myself or people who self identify as socialist and exspeed the process? Again, why not have the girls smile with Jarded Taylor then?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\>Smiling in a group photo next to someone and shooting guns' isn't legitimizing their ideas, only a crazy person thinks that.\n\nPositive association with people of a certain race or religion is one way bigots reform themselves. Its not a crazy thought at all that this applies to ideologies. You let Alex jones on your pod, you break down a thin barrier many have, and they become all the more receptive to their ideas. And considering how many unironic CCP shills and 9/11 truther are on redpod sub, its not surprising a lot would go along with some of jone's charades. Its just a numbers game.","That's what redscare is; conservative cultural critique and edge. Don't know what you expected.","I mean, I\u2019m a Medicare for all Bernie bro. I didn\u2019t vote for braindead Joe","My coworker is playing Biden's live address about 1/6, making it sound like it was the battle of Gettysburg or some shit while sucking off the cops and then this pic pops up on my feed. The dissonance between Biden's words and this old lady smiling is making it so hard not to laugh right now. I don't think she was there though.","Listening to the speech overlayed with people just milling about and taking pictures in the capitol is beyond parody.","whoa whoa you're going to have to put some centrist contrarian views on that point or get out","This wouldn\u2019t be the case under President Williamson","Redditor and liberal","Because the experiance outside of big cities is that liberals/left movement isn't just hypocritical, it's an existential threat to the core values of the United States. Liberals aren't dragging their ass down to the desert of Arizona to go see left leaning political figures, but conservatives are. To dismiss conservative viewpoints as so intellectually devoid of substance that it does not need to be responded too is in its own way elitist and short sighted. There are plenty of conservative talking points that get play in academia, these aren't mountain dew chugging yokles, these are Fedsoc members at Harvard and Yale making actual academic arguments about the nature and purpose of government that go unresponded to by Anna because some retarded liberal made fun of Joe Rogan on Twitter.","What are you talking about? To describe the Democratic party as liberal is a joke, ever since the New Democrats took power they have controlled the party. The New Democrats being the conservative wing of the Democratic party. That and the pivot to the right by the Republican party shows that more or less conservatism has a controlling grip on the country, especially if you compare it to other countries like Britain who aren't particularly liberal.","Guys who swing this hard toward woke either have right wing pasts and backgrounds or are just too autistic to figure out the moderate middle of separating your politics from the rest of your personality, so he could easily pivot wrong.","Most of the American left are beer drinking normal folks who just want decent healthcare, education and housing. The performative left who live in major metros like this clown are exactly like the right depicts.","Because empathy and human intuition has been replaced by the rules of twisted idpol logic","I think one telling thing she said recently is that she's been getting a bunch of right wing spam mail and she admits that it's even more deranged than her left leaning spam mail. Which is sort of indicative of her problem, she literally surrounds herself in an extremely liberal bubble, she lives in New York one of the most liberal cities, her core audience is liberals who complain about her being 'too conservative', I'm fairly certain most of her friends and family are very liberal, her Twitter feed is probably some of the more insufferable liberals, she admitted that the spam mail she's received was almost exclusively liberal in nature. I think that when that's all you see, then those are the positions you're going to push back on. \n\nFrom the American point of view she is an extreme leftist, but looking at it from what she surrounds herself with I think she's very deeply into leftist culture, most normal people aren't really like that they don't wait neck deep into leftist Twitter or sign up for leftist newsletters. I think day to day people aren't real familiar with that world, they sort of live their lives and interact with regular people who honestly know nothing about politics. So I think her extreme position on the left is both literally in comparison to most Americans and figuratively if you look at what she surrounds herself with.","I said it in the other thread and got downvoted for it, but this Ukraine shit never would have happened if he was still in charge \ud83d\ude24","Honestly i miss him\u2026 this all never would\u2019ve happened under trumps administration. He would\u2019ve blown up all those beautiful turrets","Not politically but as entertainment","1%? Try 0.4%. These people basically don't exist in the real world,  but so many of them are terminally online and have hijacked gay rights organizations that are desperate for new causes to fight for that their issues take center stage in liberal spaces no matter what is happening.","this reads like you're talking about a politician instead of a comic","Mogging transcends politics","What does the president have to do with who runs the country?","Most left-wing dudes are just right-wingers pretending to be left wing to get laid. Therefore right wingers are always ugly.","I'd say reagan","Hunter Biden","Reagan may have set the ball rolling that will destroy western civilisation but his joke after getting shot was legendary.","I find it funny how both sides love their guy. Republicans think Bush was tough for dodging both shoes and left wing guys think the shoe tosser is awesome for tossing his shoes.","Bernie fucked you guys over imo","well if the president said it it must be true","The liberal rehabilitation of Bush is greatly overstated and based almost entirely off two photos of him with Ellen and Michelle Obama and the typical post office bump presidents get","The libs are the ones who ended insane asylums in the first place. \n\nYou think im the era of blm and George Floyd motherfuckers are going to seriously cosign FORCEFULLY institutionalizing people? The same people who currently give the homeless carte blanche and want to abolish the police?\n\nDumbass take, get real.","Not going to happen, the libs would kill such a person.","libs who find this place after big current events are another breed. How do u read this and not imagine the guy typing it thinking he\u2019s like giving a movie speech. Worst combo of saccharine idealism and patronizing","In an effort to 'both sides' the issue this tweet makes it seem like right winger's are trying to increase mental health resources and the left hate it which could not actually be further from the truth.","What we need is a new FDR or LBJ. Even Bernie couldn't come close to either of them.","Republicans would never go for it. Great idea though","And I\u2019m neither, and most people on the high functioning end of the spectrum are probably in that middle but as with everything culture war related the extremes win out","Ehh its getting better. Our most radical, left leaning city council member will hopefully lose to a DINO with PPB backing in about a month. That's how bad she is, and kind of how fed up the people are.","Isn\u2019t that account an inveterate hater of Bernie and his bros? They\u2019re not exactly wrong here but it\u2019s pretty low-hanging fruit.","The bit he did on [twitter](https://twitter.com/stavvybaby/status/1540488390231089153?s=20&t=iaR4uS1Ufj_opp_akUF6tg) yesterday pretty much sums up the new schtick: Raunchy fat guy says progressive stuff but with a blue edge. Hope that's worth ending ct for","Lol no if anything their absence prolonged it they were always dead right. Other commenters have it right. The left lost. End of story - anyone intelligent can see that and the chapos can\u2019t openly admit it because it would cut off the money sluice.","what facts are being bent, this is comprised of nothing but police reports/legal filings and the uncherrypicked statements of various rightoids from their own mouths","beyond fucked up that the political and cultural climate is such that republican ghouls will find a way to fundraise off this absolute human tragedy and succeed.","> I cannot believe they released the name of the doctor? And they keep repeating it! Why the hell are we doxxing doctors on the news ?! It\u2019s so irresponsible, I don\u2019t even understand how this is legal. Where are the journalistic ethics here?\n\nI agree that right wing media is absolutely trying to get the doctor killed, but she wasn't \"doxxed\". She chose to go on the record publicly in the original Indianapolis Star article, and it seems likely that she's the one who brought the story to their attention in the first place. \n\nThis isn't a criticism of the doctor, I think it's extremely admirable that the she was willing to put a target on her own back in order to publicize the horrifying consequences of these insane laws.","Why would they do that? I almost don't believe you just because there's absolutely zero rationale other than sheer stupidity. From the conservative view,  you're either killing one or two people and theyre going for double. this is like hardcore wrong answer to the trolley problem level shit.","Hope I'd have in that case is Republicans are great at ratfucking but they can't seem to get much done when they're in power b/c conservatives by nature don't have an goal, just a list of things they don't like. They couldn't get Obamacare repealed with years of Trump/McConnell/Ryan\n\nIt would also require the Republicans to end the filibuster in the Senate which has been their favorite tool","The american right wing truly is it's own beast. Like at least fascists pretended/claimed to have a constructive goal they were working towards but american \"conservatives\" seem to without fail pick the option that will inflict the most suffering possible on the most amount of people. What is the origin of such a malignant psychology? Where did these sick people come from? Like conservatives talk about how the dems are secretly satanists all the time but it is just blatantly, explicitly SATANIC to want a 10 year old CHILD to carry her rape-baby to term. Incredible that this is the hill they've chosen to die on and of course there will be no consequences for them. Would it be possible to make Fox News HQ look like a school so that the next pathetic incel terrorist can kill some people who actually deserve it?","They\u2019re leaving it out so that they can rant and rave like lunatics. Should be obvious from looking at this thread where people\u2019s priorities are.","Talking about children getting raped and people raging about lefties and righties in the comments is another day in paradise huh?","i really don't understand right wingers on this. do they all have zero connection to women? what if it was your own daughter, sister or even mother who was raped? how could you be possibly ok with her having to birth a child that was not made in love and will never experience love or a home? disgusting","imagine giving a fuck about that in this circumstance. you have a broken brain if you choose to fixate on that in the face of the mechanical horror of right wing power.","Yeah, RIP George Tiller. Genuinely brave and heroic to continue working after multiple attacks. No one should ever forget how much blame Bill O\u2019Reilly deserves for his murder. It feels like we\u2019re seeing the same thing happen again before our eyes","Damn, if only there were someone with the power to lean on members of the Democratic party to convince them vote a specific way or else.\n\nOh wait, there was, his name was Barack Obama.","Conservatives are sub human goblins. Imagine being this cruel to a child. They\u2019re sick.","Americans are just obsessed with underdog stories. Republicans want to lose just to prove they are the real ones under attack, and Democrats are obsessed with the actual underdogs of America which is why you see a ton of young liberal kids jumping onto the queer identity and going nuts over trying to find black friends to increase their underdog rep, and the actual underdogs (mainly gay and black people) have relied on their underdog status for years to push their media globally (that's why rap and drag shows are in right now lol)","Saying the shit you\u2019d think people would find offensive on TV seems to have the effect opposite to alienating the audience.  Do it stridently enough and piss the right people off doing it and you\u2019ll build yourself a handy little voting bloc that can apparently become dominant in one of the country\u2019s major parties.","i said this when trump was elected and it's only gone into hyperdrive since then, what a miserable time","I mean no shit but I'm thinking of the people in power that have allowed this situation to escalate so far beyond that act of base cruelty","This place is so lib now","literally how right wing twitter posts.","Detach from realistic analysis of material conditions, attach to reactionary culture war struggles like being anti trans or climate skepticism.","They were a bunch of libs who would probably cry if I showed them my pistol.","The liberals won\u2019t be happy until every cartoon character is a sexless blob that wouldn\u2019t arouse any rational man.

So the only people willing to take up this little pet project of yours are those who understand exposing kids to deviant sexual perverts is also wrong","\"yeah uh we're right wing now, first we were socialist and now we're right wing...\" (hits vape)\n\n\"We're center left actually\"","A couple weeks ago Anna tweeted something about not being a leftist and it kind of threw me off because there wasn't really a way to read irony into it.\n\nI remember the term \"post-Leftist\" getting thrown around a lot, and I assume saying \"we're right wing now\" or whatever is just sarcastically aping the people that say they are right wing just because #itscomplicated.","a while ago people on here assured me of the fact that both the pod and the audience shifted into right wing territory which kinda threw me for a loop back then. However in this bit they are explicitly implying nothing has changed from their dirtbag left origins. \n\n\nWhy y'all lying?","Credentialism and its consequences","they are only implying that they can't possibly be bothered to think about what kind of politics they apparently have","Note that when internet platforms started tagging media for \"misinformation\" during the pandemic for questioning the origin of COVID or criticism of lockdowns, they also started doing the same for discussions of climate change that go against the \"individual responsibility\" narrative.","Lol shut the fuck up, liberal","Voting can be done collectively, the tea party is an example of that, it just usually isn\u2019t and the DNC are much better than the GOP at resisting that sort of effort","It's always been this way but only since they drifted away from your political view you think it's bad. The fact you didn't notice makes you even more retarded then them.","A: People want to ascribe vast and insidious meanings to things which are in reality rather pathetic and mundane. I mean it, seriously! What\u2019s more terrifying: the conspiracy that the world is controlled by a sinister cabal of satanists or that your neighbor is a pedophile? \n\nD: Yeah, totallyyyy","It's common knowledge in satanic circles and people in the know about occult and willful deception. Andrew Tate isn't saying anything new. He's just pandering to the conspiracy nuts. Like he is pandering to the Muslims. Semi authentic, semi fake. That's his brand. \n\nBut some conspiracies are actually real. MK ultra, Roswell, bigfoot, satanic child sacrifice rituals, Jews in Hollywood... Take your pick. There are many.\n\nI think Balenciaga is occult for sure. I want to get their stuff now.","People love to hate","That\u2019s child abuse.","\u201cExpressing the conclusions they\u2019ve logically come to\u201d.\nYou mean expressing opinions forced down their throat by mainstream woke liberal media?","Someone here once gave me shit for using the word strawman lol. They were fine with \"made up argument\" but \"strawman\" triggered them because they see it elsewhere on reddit \n\nThat's how you know all these 'socially and sexually active' people in this sub are just terminally online larpers","If libs unironically and unapologetically just started calling republicans fags and retards en masse there would be no defense to it and they\u2019d win literally every election in the US.","Remind of when Nick said that Biden would win easily if he walked up to Trump on the debate stage and punched him in the face","Treating any sort of social activism as futile because it didn't accomplish precisely what the original goal was in an apathetic \"told you so\" way without realizing these things come in waves and successful radical social change is almost always initially stonewalled","Right wingers are 99% of the time ugly as sin","Right wing people are often fat pig consumers, although I agree that is also a liberal trait (horshoe theory but about being weak soy people)","It\u2019s always so funny to see the directions that the moral handwringing of this sub ping pongs between. One minute Alex Jones getting sued out of his ass is actually a bad thing because he didn\u2019t actually shoot the kids, next everyone pretends that the consumerism and terrible nutrition of Americans is just part of any hecking wholesome family.","Back to the original point about not wearing politics on your sleeve. And honestly, same as it ever was. PCM is just the most laughable solution to the problem; it's run like a costume party without a shred of authenticity. \n\nIf your politics are rejected, either change your beliefs or change your messaging. They used to lock up socialists en masse and employ private militias against labor organizers. If your biggest concern is a corporate website's community deplatforming a few loudmouths, then the movement is as fake as it gets.","They\u2019ll do ANYTHING to appease their donors","This is snow of the instances where ideological amalgamation of socialism and liberalism internally push in opposite direction. \n\nOn the one hand they say that it is ethically wrong and exploitative, disgusting even, but on the other their bleeding hearth keeps repeating  that you can\u2019t be mean and just let people enjoy things. So the end result is looking other way and pretend that nothing more can be done.\n\nViolence and crime always existed, but people still try to eliminate them. Though in order to actually do this you need to get to the roots of the problem. And maybe in this case they are scared what lies there.","Of all the civilian weddings Obama could have drone bombed\u2026","Because libs/leftists agree with the blackpill- its just that they think its a good thing","Fucks the progressive on a daily basis","Sooo Rittenhouse and Alex Jones huh",">Unsubstantiated views\n\nThese sanctimonious libs actually believe their social views and opinions are all scientifically, unimpeachably correct and not at all a matter of personality and culture.","the last straw was hearing the phrase \u201cnew york crimes\u201d","\u2018I was nodding along to Rs\u2019s edgy brand of contrarianism until they said rittenhouse was innocent (true) and vaccines werent as effective as promised (true)\n\nWhat a little dork","Honestly a pretty fair article.  Many of us leftist listeners have been pretty annoyed by the very gay fasc turn the pod has taken.  That said, at the end of the day, A&D are just (self professed) dumb bitches who shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously.  They are just entertainers, and in that regard they\u2019re still pretty entertaining","Disingenuous.  It\u2019s about a lib not enjoying the transition from a Bernie centric dirtbag left pod into a gay Dimes Square Fauxscist LARP.","yeah there's zero (and literally ZERO, I searched the article and it's only a handful of news bots retweeting) discussion anywhere else online and they didn't quote any of the more cancelable takes from the last year (ironically the lib nyt be nice and fair tone house style saving their asses).","The sole reason this glorified blogpost was written and published was so that when people google \"Red Scare podcast\" there'll be an official, authoritative NYT article on the front page telling you they're anti-vaxx crypto-fascists who hang out with the most evil man in the world, Alex Jones, and you should definitely not listen to anything they have to say, especially if you're a leftist -- don't fall for their tricks like the author did and remain safe and content on the liberal plantation!","*Rittenhouse, the teenager who fatally shot two men and wounded another during a 2020 Black Lives Matter protest in Wisconsin.*\n\nmissing the crucial \"in self defense\" as anyone who has watched the video has seen\n\ni hate the corporate press","Come on, they\u2019ve done more than just talk to Jones, they actively stan him at this point.  And the shock jock rittenhouse was just the tip of that iceberg, there are countless examples of (especially, but not only) Anna flip flopping to reactionary opinions on a number of topics.\n\nBut hey, like I said, I still find the pod entertaining most of the time.  One just has to accept them as shock jock contrarians who will pander to whichever cultural winds seem to be blowing in a monetizable direction.","you must be really intelligent by giving into capitals cooptation of leftist causes","If anything that just shows that these communities aren't populated by brainless sheep.  \nThey all still love Andrew's content, but their personal principles and views of sexual assault are a bit more stronger than their adoration for a content creator.    \n\nIf anything the fans would look worse if they didn't turn on him and just mindlessly defended him because fuck yeah Andrew","I'm sorry but I'm struggling to understand how turning on Andrew (whose content was the primary driver of this parasocial relationship) shows that they are mindless?    \n\nCan you please give me an example of how a non-mindless person, who is a regular follower of Andrew's content, would react to these accusations?",">leftist \"coomunities\" are filled with ressentiment\nShocker, I know.","Anyone who appears on television is lib until proven otherwise","They are cute libs \ud83d\ude0a","You are lowering yourself to their level by giving any attention to it at all.\n\nThese are people that everyone should have hatred for. This is bipartisan. \n\nLeft vs right is a machination to keep the lower classes eternally infighting.","People outwardly hate the thing that they hate the most about themself.","Kinda disagree that 10s are apolitical. They can be whatever they want: fascist, raging commie etc. Someone will always want to smash. It is we, the mortals, that are agnostic about their politics.","These are people who think that the mere realization that history exists at all is some kind of massive moral victory. Because they can then immediately act to tie it into how they live in the present. \n\nAll of history has lead to the point where we, the enlightened liberal denizens of X Place, can pontificate about human rights and how everyone definitely deserves, or rather deserved, to have them. We would have wanted them, that's for sure. Anyways, back to business.","Serious answer:\n\n* very little real-life experience of employment/relationships etc so they respond (online) in hyperbolic, emotionally-immature ways\n* their lives don't come anywhere close to their (inaccurate) idea of the perfect pastel lives of their K-pop idols (who are usually emotionally and physically abused and are often sexually abused) so they have a lot of bitterness in their hearts\n* they \"engage\" with culture online where the stakes are extremely low and responding with horrific threats of violence has no consequence\n* the prevailing rhetoric online in \"leftist\" \"liberal\" \"spaces\" is surprisingly hateful (or is it surprising?) and this seeps through to non-political discussions","What are you talking about, ever hear of 1st black pres. Bill Clinton?","If you ignore social/cultural issues","I get it nowand I agree to me its so dumb when making fun of a politicians appearance because being ugly is not a sin. Various war crimes, corruption, racketeering etc. are.","Assassinating one of your best friends and one of the greatest civil rights activists before spending the next half a century spewing violent racial hatred makes you a pretty evil individual, I'd say.","Media illiteracy and its consequences","Because Repubs ain't the only ones being scammed. They still lost their seat to him.","supposing that i was a fan of Bernie Sanders, when pressed why, i definitely would not have gone to \"uh...because he's a socialist\"--as i nervously looked at my phone and sipped on an iced coffee.","There\u2019s literally always another excuse they provide for other\u2019s outright shitty behavior, and if not an excuse it\u2019s because it\u2019s part of some grand idea of resisting the state of course.","It's one of the reasons I respect Liz Bruenig, she doesn't dance around the crimes of the people she's advocating for. She wrote an interesting editorial about how hard it is to get people to care about the rights of someone who has done something indisputably evil, but in her view we have to. \n\nIt's not like those people who are like \"Greg Abbot is killing a man with a 78 IQ, it's Aktion T4 all over again!\"\n\nThen you pull the rap sheet and it's like \"After bashing in the man's head to take the $10 bill in his wallet to buy candy with, the perpetrator painted his favorite cartoon characters on the sidewalk using the victim's blood and viscera\"","Anarchism has jack fuck to offer. Their claim to fame is \"mutual aid\" but there's not a single anarchist mutual-aid collective that has done more quality, consistent charity work than the run-of-the-mill church. Also blackbloc is retarded larping and extremely counterproductive. It scares normal people and makes them want more police presence. \n\nThere is zero excuse for anarchism in 21st century and I despise all of them.","This is what happens when you want anarchy but also bare minimum cant call people slurs","At this point what has the word \"based\" come to even mean to you? You've apparently decided that shitting in a hole is good because there's a scenario where it might offend a hypothetical liberals sensibilities. What do you supposed happened that got you to this point in your life?","I wonder if the democrats miscalculated and thought that if they don\u2019t go after him during the election they can use him as a symbol of the inherent rottenness and dishonesty of the Republican Party. Little did they know\u2026","Apparently the DCCC does basic oppo research that they give to candidates, but will just flag stuff for further investigation. Whether or not to investigate it further is up to the candidate, and they have to pay for that themselves. The Dem candidate had limited funds and decided to put it into organizing and grass roots efforts instead.\n\nYou really have to wonder how much the Dems pay those consultants to go \"Damn, that seems sketchy, you should have someone look into that.\"","it all comes back to leftism","I know a lot of people who call themselves anarchists. The truest meme i ever saw had a photo of people throwing Molotov cocktails or whatever labeled \u201cwhat people think anarchism is\u201d and the second image was text that said \u201cokay it\u2019s been 10 hours but we now have consensus on the use of the word \u2018guys\u2019 in meetings.\u201d","This says a lot about society","Anyone that says this hasn't been sucked off by Nancy 'the throat goat' Reagan.","as far as I'm concerned you're engaging in the culture war with this post","Being anti woke from a left perspective isn't meta at all it just makes you a left leaning centrist","If the news make leftists mad then they are uplifting news.","most wammen say conservative shit in private and then liberal shit in public","By \"leftist\" I meant the most [basic textbook definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left%E2%80%93right_political_spectrum) of favoring egalitarianism over hierarchies rather than particular political parties or institutions.\n\nThe mob is a quintessential social hierarchy and the show is critical of the mob.  Since it's critical of hierarchies, it's therefore leftist in a more general way than \"supports the Democrats\" or \"Trump is bad\".  I guess this a more abstract definition of \"leftist\" than I probably should have used.","I support Azealia when it comes to her beef with Julia Fox.

Extreme hall monitor energy.","And you know he votes liberal 100% of the time. Average twitter \"leftist\"","I think it's pretty established at this point that virtually no one is a \"moderate\" in the sense that they agree universally with what \"moderate politicians\" say.

I posted some nonsense I thought the sub would enjoy and was variously accused of neglecting my marriage, neglecting my kids, looking to be unfaithful etc. Lots of the abuse was funny and there were some insightful comments on the situation too (which was extremely low-stakes and not even something which I was that closely involved with). I'm old enough and ugly enough not to care much either way what reaction I get online to anonymous posts but even still I did at points regret putting the situation \"out there.\"","Because this sub is full of idpol schizos that aren't very self aware.

The sub is one of the few non-shitty cultural/political subs on reddit but I stopped listening to the girls a while ago once it became clear that they're not particularly smart, they're too lazy to be informed about much other than the new Kanye album, and that their \"edgy\" takes are just attention seeking nihilism.","There's a lot of people here who think that, given the level of discourse on here for the past two weeks.","It's the all time top post on this sub..","Making stuff up about someone and then getting mad about it is what makes this site so fun to me.",">grillpilled straight dudes \n\nDon't follow Tim Dillon regularly, but after having looked up what this shit means, it seems like a good description of what I feel like very often. there really is a word for everything.\n\ndon't worry, I don't think I'll litter your sub here though","Can we just pin this post and close the sub down now","Judging by that site that analyzing proportional activity of posters here on other subreddits, they're also struggling with baldness and never grew out of their dad's Grateful Dead phase.","Bro it\u2019s just a play on the original \u201carethestraightsok\u201d sub","Lol @ everyone in this sub praising this while also calling themselves a \u201cbpd queen\u201d","Like how this sub seethes over Twitter poasts?","\u201cI don\u2019t know, I just had hoped that this strange anonymous Internet forum that I comment on was filled with well-adjusted, attractive bohemians.\u201d\n\nLike, what did you people expect","i hate to be that guy but it really was so much better. idk what sub got banned and all their losers came here but it clearly happened","Looks like it was locked because it broke a rule about meta posting, not because it upset people. Most of the commenters seem to agree with the meme and find it funny.","which sub was this on lmaoooo","My guess is they don\u2019t want the sub to become one big circlejerking inside joke but it\u2019s pretty stupid","Reading anyone's ideas about *anything*, yours or OP's, is the doomscroll brainworm of the modern age. You say your little weak piece, you get your feelies from it, then you go back to being a non-contributing zero. I'm talking to myself, too.\n  \n\"Sheeple\" is actually super relevant. Tahrir Square or bust, basically.","Once you get over 100K subscribers, every subreddit becomes the same.","I forget how young this sub is sometimes.","You really followed me to another sub. Grow up lol","I agree with you. I'm paranoid enough to avoid posting all my best and most interesting ideas and theories on the sub, mostly because I want to work on them in depth under my own name, but also because there are vultures all over places like this looking for material to repackage as their own.

They invited /r/vegancirclejerk to the offsite because of something that happened on reddit. Vegans then started turboposting (like they are prone to do) and started doing shit like tagging posts with meat in them as gore in the food sub. Just funny shit to be irritating but also being super angry and confrontational to the point where even chapos were getting fed up.\n\nThere was this whole thing about the indigenous right to eat meat or something (memory is hazy). Shit got to a boiling point several times and from what I gather everyone either got bored or realized that it was super embarrassing to have the public-facing part of your site that you wanted to use as a \"leftward pipeline\" basically tearing itself apart every month or so. There was this pronoun struggle session that was similar but less scorched earth. Drama drama drama, not sure if it's archived anywhere. The transcomrade69 saga was a funny one too. \n\nI wonder what they're up to now.","he's probably on this sub right now!","This is something that I've only recently realized about this website. It's a fantastic resource but it's filled to the brim with literal children who have no idea what they're talking about.","People arguing in your replies about lotr lore are proof of how far this sub has fallen","yeah this is exactly why i keep coming back to this sub","No, this sub just gets r slurred like this sometimes","Yeah I think that applies to a lot of the sub","Whoa where can I learn more about\nThat?\n\nIdk what this sub even is I just stumbled on this post somehow but I like it","I feel like this sub doesn\u2019t even bother not appearing misogynistic though?","Lol\n\nOf course this sub would heavily upvote this old tiktok talking point. I wonder why.","i have learnt to never underestimate the level of unearned smugness and spasticated worldview the men of this subreddit have","Yeah this sub has always leaned that way, it\u2019s not really anything new","Idk if anyone else noticed but r/ seduction got snuffed out a few weeks ago. I have pretty mixed feelings on that sub but there was some good non-cucked advice over there. \n\nThere's like zero resources outside of extremism and grifters to go to now for younger men who are struggling.","Maybe it wasnt \u201cGood\u201d in a traditional sense, but it was at least more interesting to browse & post on. And I\u2019m aware it was always terminally online degenerates posting here but least they had more personality.","it's not about people being younger, it's about the culture of the place\n\ni like the posting culture of this subreddit and i don't like the posting culture of most reddit chat. i get that in both spaces it's people trying to match their tone to the people around them but god i find the smug nerdy referential humour and faux-intellectualism of reddit at large so much worse than the smug disaffected \"trying to look like i don't care\" faux-intellectualism of this space\n\nso it's sad if the posting culture of this place becoming more like the rest of this godawful site","i copy and paste alot of my comments cause alot of the same questions and sentiments pop up here regularly. i used to get really annoyed by them but i've eased off alot since alot of regulars here genuinely are unwell and/or lonely and it's not good to get annoyed at people trying to cope with it, since it's just natural that they try. be it posting about basic questions about life, oversharing their personal lives with strangers that are united by just being in the same niche subreddit or desperately trying to avoid conforming to cheesy online forum etiquette\n\nactually i'm less charitable to the latter","Sub is much younger, normies, and there are more women posters than there used to be. It's pretty much comprised of people you'd see at Coachella now","Post a slur or get banned.\n\nThe book posting has gone downhill too. Buncha illiterates sharing front page and tiktok content on here.","yea it\u2019s whack, started browsing here during the pandemic and liked the art/film:music stuff and the hyper critical judgmental side but now it\u2019s jsut a parody of itself","Idk making posts saying \u2018it was cool before all the posers turned up\u2019 is kinda trash to begin with. It might be worse atm because people are bored and drunk over Christmas and want to start drama.","I've been posting here for a couple years and the only thing I've noticed lately is a lot more people bitching about it. Would suggest shutting the fuck up but YMMV.","When you start getting Avatar apologists on this sub that\u2019s when you know you there needs to be a purge","if you go through old posts on here people have been complaining about the sub\u2019s vibes sinking for like 3 years straight","This sub has never been good","I see what you mean, it's a fine line to tread with this sub. It swings constantly between disarming sincerity and assholish cynicism with no inbetween. At the end of the day it's just the internet though, don't sweat too much about it.","The way that Reddit is setup there's been a few interesting niche subs homogenized into the fold over time. But this one's funny as it's made such a fuss over it, kicking and screaming as it goes under.","This sub can be so contrarian lmao. \"it's cringe to drink water out of a can at parties\"...what?","I remember when thedonald sub was so popular it dominated the front page and reddit changed their whole algorithm to deny that.","> The off-topic subforums were usually a mess\n\nThe UGHH forums late 90s, ashamed of how much time I spent arguing with people on the General Discussion board","Is this the disney sub","You're blind if you authentically believe the sub actually operates that way. It's a safe-space for reactionary kids who think that the rest of reddit is too liberal for their tastes. It doesn't take long at all to recognize the amount of ridicule and downvotes someone with a \"left\" flair gets, and how all their bookish takes trying to \"save\" the alt-right are treated as hot air. They operate under this guise of open-discourse, but it's really just a /pol/ pipeline.","It's a fucking dialectic exercise holy shit you really go on reddit and screech at people?\n\nI support legalization, if you can't fuckin tell. I also acknowledge my own prejudice and am trying to get people in this sub to move past theirs.","this is a contrarian sub","Drama dot net is a little much for me tbh. The subreddit was great but it\u2019s been shut down for 6 months.\n\nI\u2019ll check out motte I guess but I never browsed pol","Not while I'm still alive and ed_butteredtoast still pounds my heart. The only sub to ever escape the fate of ban or quarantine, but get subjected to hard code targeting specifically them so that they couldn't mention usernames.","I honestly think we're being Astro-turfed some of the speaking patterns and general attitudes don't feel natural on this subreddit","I feed on the nihilism & snark here, the unmasked criticism feels like a breath of fresh air. But no doubt I find it overbearing at times, constructive bullying is by no means a tenant of the mainstream.","tbf coming on this subreddit is a bad habit I wish I could kick","Lmao they were gonna shut down the sub over this","I kicked the red scare bug by getting banned from the sub for months","that happened to me. in 2020 and 2021 i talked a lot of shit about the covid regime. got banned from multiple subs (sometimes without even participating in said sub) for saying shit that actually turned out to be 100% true but at the time was very taboo. i got down voted a lot, i was told i should kill myself on more than one occasion, and told my sources  were dog shit even when i cited government agencies. eventually i got booted from the whole thing and have since been more low key mostly just sticking to this sub and calling people gay retards. a lot of the discourse around covid has died off too. although i want people to hang for it","This is far too many upvotes for this sub","Seems like people are treating this sub like Yik Yak.","if they never banned the incel subs this wouldn't have happened","Sorry friend, this sub is the only place on the internet that has this vibe and it made me feel a little vulnerable.","An anonymous app for college students where they post weird, boring, dumb, thirsty bullshit. At least that\u2019s what it is now with the revamped version. The original version a few years back was pretty much just all racism, misogyny, and threats of violence.","It was quickly exhale through nose funny, which is better than 90% of this sub.","Dude his subreddit is in such dire straights now and they\u2019re almost gleefully deriding dude and how \u201cthis ackkchuuuly isn\u2019t at all surprising\u201d\n\n\nWhat happens when the bulk of your audience gets off on e z intellectual dunks, are emotionally vapid zoomers, and who have zero restraints about eating their own even if it\u2019s only based on *checks notes* tik Tok confessionals.\n\n\nShit rules.","Gonna play devils advocate here because I do post like this on those subs, albeit I try to post in the correct FIRE subs and not general subs like personal finance.  I do it because I\u2019ve been following those subreddits since before I started college and they\u2019ve been great resources as I\u2019ve gotten older and made more money.  I also consider managing my finances a legitimate hobby of mine and something I consider very interesting even if I\u2019m not talking about my own money.  I think the age/net worth/career posts help provide context.  All that being said I agree it can come off as snobbish if you\u2019re not used to seeing numbers thrown out like that in general discussion, and many of those subs have tailored away from useful advice to stroking grounds.","This is funny but a question to people who joined this sub years ago, how often did posts from here get hundreds of upvotes?","One of the things people often talk about is how subs start going to shit as they get larger. 100k is usually the tipping point where there the typical redditors start becoming noticeably present. You know, \"those\" fucking lame as theater kid dorks. Once it hits critical mass, their stupid shit can't just be bullied or downvoted into silence, because all the other fucking losers they keep inviting, upvote them. To make it worse, Reddit's native app has some stupid \"Similar communities\" feature when browsing other subs... So it just funnels in people from all these places we try to avoid.","You should check out that cloudheads or whatever sub","We should have locked the sub the second CT was banned","It's a really weird feeling going into one of those subs and just disagreeing with literally every single reply.","Is this subreddit full of tankies or just leftists that are staying on brand by not understanding economics? This is a genuine question and I\u2019m not trying to start a bad faith conversation.","Do 10s use anonymous internet forums? I suppose Doja Cat used to, although she was kind of a non-anonymous mini-celeb power poster on those edgelord boards","had to double check the sub this comment was so out of place jfc","I gotta say, completely outside of us disagreeing, this sub\u2019s comebacks have been atrocious.","Every qt and reply was a variation on this take, call it the hive mind.","We're in a subreddit centered around two vocal-fry girls dishing out half-informed takes and racist jokes... do we really have room to talk here","Men and Women both post and rate on the sub","Obviously pictures have limitations in that they distort images and cant provide measurements. The sub makes its best attempt to be objective *according to its scale*. If you think the scale is wrong or stupid thats fine","Also LOL I just went to that sub and the top post right now is straight out of one of those 4chan \"You see her at a party, how do you open?\" memes (DNI, by Allah control yourselves) and you click on it and the ratings are all 5s from top to bottom with no further elaboration\n\nAlso they're looking for people who want to become mods, we should send in a saboteur","It\u2019s amazing how little has changed. Almost anything that hits the front page will have a variation of one of these as the top comment. There are many reasons I\u2019ve given up on the rest of Reddit, but this is near the top.","hard agree, that sub is deranged. Ever single per gets a 5. Theres a bunch of links stickied to the sub to teach you how to rate people? The sub would function much better if you gave an honest rating and a short description","It\u2019s impossible to tell when a racist comment will skyrocket your popularity or get downvoted into oblivion in this sub. A classic Russian roulette to keep things interesting","I actually post in a lot of other subs but my posts always get deleted because of all the racial slurs.","you know how this sub is lol","> How about normalize shutting the fuck up\u201d\n\nHere's the thing. There's been a whole lot of tubes, and people can just dump whatever they want on them. And they travel, yes travel, like instantly, across the vast ocean of AOLs. And you and I, with our Blackberrys, can read their shitposts.","The libertine posters come to this sub to get scolded by the reactionary trads. The reactionary trads come to this sub to experience the libertine lifestyle by proxy.","Right that explains it then. Reddit is obsessed with him so this sub is counterjerking a bit too far in the other direction","Evangelion is an exception though, just like on this sub","That sub seems super supportive of trans and non binary lesbians too lol","This sub sometimes feels like the off-topic section of an internet forum from 2008","No its just cringey this sub going down the drain","How are people downvoting this, I thought this sub was like the only one where jokes and not being a total pussy were still allowed","You\u2019re right about this sub, but you also see a lot of people on this site who are radically weird and genuinely believe it should be a black and white rule to alienate yourself from your coworkers","Wow that sub is nuts","idk this sub does seem to go out of its way to get annoyed at these people when you can just close the computer","Less exaggerated comments expressing the same kind of spirit do not do badly in the subreddit.","Redditors get offended when you explain to them everyone else's mind works the same as theirs. really ruins their fostered delusion about having some secret, unique intellect\n\ni once read a guy's essay on r/intj about how he immediately began analyzing new situations (i.e., if he's jogging and sees a hint of red from behind a corner on the sidewalk, he searches his memory for its texture and shape, deducts the color's compatible with clothing he's seen, and processes it's the sleeve of a sweater laying on the ground or something)\n\nhe got markedly irate when i told him that everyone does this. he was legitimately impressed with his ability to do it","My gf told me this sub was great to follow because it was unhinged and there's a lot of LARPers, but I'm genuinely surprised how many people actually like Dasha and Anna. I haven't heard their podcast yet besides one episode while I was driving, but I feel like I'd rather watch Sonic fandom content on YouTube than whatever else they have to say.\n\nYou could pull a Reddit comment from the politics sub and I wouldn't be surprised if it somehow aligned with them.","The top post all time of that sub is insanely beautiful","80% of this sub apparently","I remember the last time a pro-gun post made it to the front page... and to sweeten things, it was on /r/PoliticalHumor.\n\nIt got locked and removed (top comments were pro-gun too) a few hours later. Literally the last time I've seen one allowed to get that popular.","I just went over to the gangstalking sub to see what it was about (assumed it was a place for \"gangstalkers\" to congregate lol) and I literally don't get what's going on over there. Is this just a community of people suffering from paranoia? These posts sound so sincere and trolly at the same time.","Always have in mind that this sub is mostly people who share the same worldview as the frontpage posters but they don't want to be viewed as frontpage posters because those posters are not cool","Redditors also don't think about how what they regularly post and upvote to the front page and top of comments would appear to most bystanders in public as seriously unhinged and deranged meltdown behavior. \n\nNot even the sweet self righteousness that gets buried at the end of commentary would be enough to save you from embarrassment.\n\nEveryone thinks they're the guy in the Norman Rockwell painting standing up at the town hall with a copy of the constitution hanging from their jacket pocket.","Wasn\u2019t this a schizo comment on the sub a week or two back??","i bet most of that was them wanting to see a guy pummel a woman since a lot of the popular subreddits dgaf about the n word","Bullying this guy is too easy and uninspired for this sub, borinnnnng","Not directly, but they exacerbated the opposite side of the house into serious idpol discourse which then triggers the libs to counteract with insane takes as well.\n\nI forgot to mention, the eastern euro trans bait farms were delivering content on both sides of the \u201cdebate\u201d. Like the same entities would be running both a super woke pro idpol page AND the right wing page.","i just like posting and i can't even do that how I want anymore because people are out to get me idk idk ik i shouldn't care but still. it is so annoying",],

To be bored simply means to be removed from the communicative sensation-stimulus matrix of texting, YouTube and fast food; to be denied, for a moment, the constant flow of sugary gratification on demand. Some students want Nietzsche in the same way that they want a hamburger; they fail to grasp - and the logic of the consumer system encourages this misapprehension - that the indigestibility, the difficulty is Nietzsche. An illustration: I challenged one student about why he always wore headphones in class. He replied that it didn't matter, because he wasn't actually playing any music. In another lesson, he was playing music at very low volume through the headphones, without wearing them. When I asked him to switch it off, he replied that even he couldn't hear it. Why wear the headphones without playing music or play music without wearing the headphones? Because the presence of the phones on the ears or the knowledge that the music is playing (even if he couldn't hear it) was a reassurance that the matrix was still there, within reach. Besides, in a classic example of interpassivity, if the music was still playing, even if he couldn't hear it, then the player could still enjoy it on his behalf. The use of headphones is significant here - pop is experienced not as something which could have impacts upon public space, but as a retreat into private 'Oedlpod' consumer bliss, a walling up against the social. The consequence of being hooked into the entertainment matrix is twitchy, agitated interpassivity, an inability to concentrate or focus. Students' incapacity to connect current lack of focus with future failure, their inability to synthesize time into any coherent narrative, is symptomatic of more than mere demotivation. It is, in fact, eerily reminiscent of Jameson's analysis in 'Postmodernism and Consumer Society'. Jameson observed there that Lacan's theory of schizophrenia offered a\n\n\n\n'suggestive aesthetic model' for understanding the fragmenting of subjectivity in the face of the emerging entertainment-industrial complex. 'With the breakdown of the signifying chain', Jameson summarized, 'the Lacanian schizophrenic is reduced to an experience of pure material signifiers, or, in other words, a series of pure and unrelated presents in time'. Jameson was writing in the late 1980s - i.e. the period in which most of my students were born. What we in the classroom are now facing is \r\na generation born into that ahistorical, anti-mnemonic blip culture - a generation, that is to say, for whom time has always \r\ncome ready-cut into digital micro-slices. \r\nIf the figure of discipline was the worker-prisoner, the figure of control is the debtor-addict. Cyberspatial capital operates by \r\naddicting its users; William Gibson recognized that in Neuromancer when he had Case and the other cyberspace \r\ncowboys feeling insects-under-the-skin strung out when they unplugged from the matrix (Case's amphetamine habit is plainly the substitute for an addiction to a far more abstract speed). If, then, something like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a pathology, it is a pathology of late capitalism - a consequence of being wired into the entertainment-control circuits of hypermediated consumer culture. Similarly, what is called dyslexia may in many cases amount to a post-lexia. Teenagers process capital's image-dense data very effectively without any need to read -slogan-recognition is sufficient to navigate the net-mobile-magazine informational plane. 'Writing has never been capitalism's thing. Capitalism is profoundly illiterate', Deleuze and Guattari argued in Anti-Oedipus. 'Electric language does not go by way of the voice or writing: data processing does without them both'. Hence the reason that many successful business people are dyslexic (but is their post-lexical efficiency a cause or effect of their success?)\"\n--Mark Fisher","Reading comprehension","Reading comprehension","I would not know, I didn\u2019t read it.","A Confederacy of Dunces made a similar joke in the 1960s where the fat pretentious blowhard who hates every aspect of modern life loves to read Batman comics.","Yeah it\u2019s seriously the only time that enjoying things like that makes sense. Reading Alan Moore\u2019s comics as a teenager was a big deal, and I think those are the only ones that still hold up today - and yet Moore has since disavowed comics.","Alan Moore*, and Moore is a gifted writer but also a shameless hypocrite who'll say anything in defense of his own activities or interests. His points about fascism are nested in reality but also wildly overstated","I like the ones who are using ring lights or are obviously reading","i was obsessed w lolita so yes","less magazine art bc i just don\u2019t get magazines anymore but yes i draw and tape polaroids in when im telling a story about an event. like to include a visual.","Hm... maybe I could make a living as a writer when I grow up","feel like pure shit just want classy, stately, academic bookstores back","Take the Antiquarian/Rare Bookstore pill. You avoid all the garbage and trade it for boomer shopkeepers excited to sell you a signed first edition twice your age or some low print academic press title.","And where did you meet these people? Genuinely curious. Did you saddle up to them in a bookstore and say, \u201cthat\u2019s a good one?\u201d I would like to live in a world where things like that are commonplace, but I just don\u2019t think its true.","you need to start reading books my man","you are right that i should read more books but if you're really reading for pleasure or to absorb information that interests you idk to what extent that rly translates into reading faster","> I read most of those daily mail articles\n\nI read this kind of trash too and try to convince myself that I'm \"different\" from the typical reader, that I'm reading it with a) a sense of moral disgust at the intrusion and b) enough intelligence to spot the dreadful writing, the hypocritical omissions and the blatant attempts at manipulating readers. But I'm still reading it and I'm still having a grubby wallow in the sordid details, so I think I'm just kidding myself.","Sounds like it\u2019s for girls like the one you just described insisting you read it","What's the book","Reminds me I used to print out news stories to discuss at the lunch table in middle school",">go read some books\n\nwhy do that when I can just tell everyone else to read books on a podcast subreddit","How are her characters in The Menu, The Northman, and The VVitch the same??","I plan on it. I'm currently occupied by other literature for school, though","This type of person is the reason we all have to read Anne Frank's diary in school.","But that can give you such lists of books to quote!","I was just reviewing this with my 9th graders","Sounds like what a reader would say","For a lot of cases, I imagine so. But surely the writing skills you develop by writing longer papers over longer periods of time are very different from those used in writing exercises in exams. So maybe those skills are destined to be abandoned.","Read *The Rest Is Noise* by Alex Ross over the weekend and fake it till you make it","I don't believe for a second he read most of those.  Sparknotes for sure though","There's no subreddit I despise more than that one.\n\n\nEveryone there has this pathetic obsession with being \"someone who reads\" and they all desperately crave approval and reassurance that they're reading the \"correct\" way (Is it ok if I don't finish books? Is it ok if use a kindle? Is it ok if I only read shitty YA? Is it ok if I only listen to audiobooks? Is it ok if i read really fast? Is it ok if I read really slow? Is it ok if I just flip through a book after seeing the movie?)\n\nJust this whole insecurity about fucking reading at the most basic level is so pathetic. Full on \"let people enjoy things\" directed at some imaginary bogeymen and book-police. \n\nAny discussion on there are always the same observations about the same books - yes, Frankenstein's a dickhead and the monster's kinda nice, yes, we do be living in 1984, yes, the Count of Monte Cristo is great.","It's bizarre, the main criticism of books they have is \"This is a bad book because the main character is an unlikable person/I can't relate to the main character\"\n\nHow do these people even graduate high school when they have zero reading comprehension or media literacy skills?\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10n19ev/what_is_the_meaning_of_the_depth_patrick_bateman/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10nee8w/american_psycho_why_does_patrick_bateman_keep/\n\nTwo posts in the last 24 hours asking why the main character in American Psycho is a psycho. Gee whiz, good question","there's some [reckoning](https://www.apmreports.org/episode/2019/08/22/whats-wrong-how-schools-teach-reading) happening in the American educational system right now involving reading. apparently teachers have been teaching reading all wrong for decades now and they're only just now getting around to admitting this is the case. the way this person describes reading is exactly the way that kids are being taught to read wrong.\n\n they're taught to skip words they don't understand and go back later to read the words again when they finish the sentence so they have context for it (they don't go back though so that's bad advice), taught to look at pictures for more clarity (except books stop having pictures in them quickly so that's obviously bad advice) and taught to only sound out the first few letters so the rest of the word will make sense (??) all of this adds up to a lifetime of skimming hard and never absorbing anything.","tbh i remember at school the teachers would say you should like 'skim' the text first and then they would explain the difference between 'skimming' and 'scanning'\n\nhonestly some real boardroom crackheads coming with these ideas.\n\nbasically like saying 'when you talk to someone, try not to listen to *everything* they say, but wait patiently until they run out of things to say and quickly write down 5 key words' or when watching a flim 'use your mind to fast forward and make a brain note of any particular interesting things to rewatch later in your mindhole'\n\nlike **no** you legit read one word after the other and that's legit the entire process and if you disagree you need help immediately from a doctor","Listen to the podcast, Sold a Story. I\u2019m student teaching and this shit is interesting to follow. Of course it\u2019s easy to blame teachers but really it\u2019s large publishing companies and the academics that developed the incorrect theories purposefully misleading school districts and teachers into believing that their insanely expensive programs were effective. \n\nAlso, before any of y\u2019all act like this is a new development that proves societal decline, these programs were at their height in 90\u2019s and it was actually George Bush and his wife that pushed for an overhaul of the way literacy is taught to focus more on phonics (the necessary skills needed to read). But unfortunately, shady shit among the phonics camp made them lose credibility and the 2009 recession basically halted the widespread implementation of the effective programs.","I read wikipedia summaries of stuff like Don Quixote so I can pretend to be cultured","I teach 9th grade English. In an average class of 25, I would only say around 5~ could read a whole novel independently and comprehend it.","Honestly it doesn't compare to the efficacy of physically looking up a word in the dictionary. There is something about ruminating over what the author might mean in context while you shuffling through those thin pages that helps to learn the words.","I have a book called *How to Read a Book* and the author states it\u2019s bad to get hung up on finding the meaning of a certain word. I found it also distracting to have to look up a word every fifteen seconds while reading *Infinite Jest*.\n\nI don\u2019t know who\u2019s correct, though.","Tbh this is how I read academic books when I was in grad school. They're typically very formulaic and I had to read about 3-4 books a week between my seminars and the prep for my thesis. In theory, you CAN read books this way but you will only get the basic gist of them which you can fill out the details of by reading reviews of the book.","Yeah. \n\nFrom my experience in the education sector in the U.K., maybe 30% of kids from poor/poor-ish backgrounds will ever be able to read a fairly complex novel. \n\nIt\u2019s at the point where the majority of the class in a poor school will have some kind of diagnosed learning disability. And there are quite a lot of bright kids aged 12-14 who can\u2019t read/write fluently. \n\nYou\u2019ve got classes where 20+% of them are dyslexic, and it\u2019s like am I really meant to believe that many of you have a neurological problem with reading? How many have just been completely failed by the education system.","I find that this is more of a thing for the first dozen pages I read in a single session. After that I'm usually able to lock in to the activity and focus on it, at which point understanding what I'm reading becomes effortless -- but before that it can be like pulling teeth.","What do you mean by dissect? Like he\u2019d get you to pick apart each sentence and explain why each word was used? I tutor and neeeed to do this","Idk if this is pretentious but reading never felt like a \"hobby\" to me, it's just something you do. I don't get how someone can not read","Meditations is one of the best philosophy books for most people to read. Most cant handle the bullshit of relativism or phenomenology etc nor should they try. Just live a simple life as best as you can. Stoicism isn't right for everyone but for a lot of \"serious\" but not bookish people it can be fruitful.\n\nthe best part about it is that you dont even have to read it read it, its pretty much all maxims, put it in the bathroom","Yeah so note that i said close reading which entails both taking notes on what you read and making sure you understand everything. Also significant these are scholarly works so pretty dense. For me, at least, that\u2019s impossible when it pushes past around 600 pages a week.","Yeah this is how I read (some) academic books, especially for research when I have so much to cover in a small amount of time. Not a novel though, I don't understand how anyone can skim-read a novel.","I remember there was a running joke on /lit/  years ago that if you vocalized words in your head as you were reading them you were retarded or something like that lmao","I think I kind of understand this, there's a point in reading fast when you are no longer sounding out all the words in your head like a narrator's voice but just absorbing words and sentences.","I genuinely miss rage comics. They've somehow looped back around to being funny again. Although I guess wojaks are just the rage comics of the 2020s","STEM students who reach the masters level comprehend what they are reading. Does it matter that 11th graders who will eventually become nurses or assistants for mortgage brokers understand the intricacies of Lolita?","They all show up in that one sleepy girl book","Not going to lie, that's the only way I can read Dickens.","Never read this one. I liked *A man saw a ball of gold in the sky* though and *The Red Badge of Courage* of course.","It was cool. Anybody read the book? Should I?","yes it\u2019s good he repeats himself a lot so you can probably skim when he does that and it\u2019s a lot quicker of a read","Read The War of Art. Quick and easy read.","I mean, couldn't anyone make a shit book in 10 days, ai or not","Also another note: if you want to lead a book club you must **always** be 3-4 sessions ahead of everyone else, otherwise you will eventually fall off (as it happened to you). Take it from someone who has led successfully 6 book clubs (and failed badly 3 times, just like you did)",],

He just sounded like a dopey dude who had a genuine interest in learning about subjects and topics. Honestly, he was incredibly apolitical. If anything, he sounded almost libertarian but even that was a bit of stretch. I liked hearing him talk with comics, UFC fighters, health/food scientists, land general pop culture personalities - especially ones in food since that was a personal interest for me.\n\nBut one thing I noticed consistently, Joe was always a sponge for the guests. Whatever their view was, he was pretty open to it and allowed them to talk without making it feel like they had to suppress themselves which I thought was really good for an interview host since it's an important quality to get a genuine interview. \n\nEventually, I got tired and bored of the podcast. The guests got droll and boring. I was sick of hearing the story about The Machine or Joey Diaz kidnapping somebody. I stopped listening altogether. \n\nI tried listening recently; it was still unremarkable. It was a few comics who's podcasts I prefer now but Rogan remains unchanged. He's still just a dude with a Golden Retrievers brain who knows how to host a podcast.\n\nI don't fully understand why there's this movement to call him a nazi or alt-right or conservative but it feels like just a weird pushback from bluechecks and libs because he doesn't want to conform to the status quo narrative. I mean, if somebody was taking the word of a UFC commentator and comedian as fact, wouldn't that be a worse reflection of society at large than a multimillion dollar podcaster?","I try to listen while I\u2019m like doing dishes or cleaning and can usually get about an hour in before I have to turn it off. Just the same convo 99% of the time and I hate listening to stand-ups complimenting each other when he has those guys on.","Huh? It's literally the other way around. Joe himself has always been kinda \"meh\" but he has on interesting guests (sometimes). Any time I have ever listened to/watched JRE, it has absolutely been because of the guest, not the host. Joe Rogan himself is very middle-of-the-road in terms of talent, personality, intellect, etc. I will say, though, that I think most of the current hate towards him is totally knee-jerk and ideologically driven groupthink. I've been sort of surprised by some of the nasty, hateful shit I've been seeing r/averageredditor types spewing about him.","Yeah, I would agree to an extent. He stand-up was always pretty par for the course for that 00s-early10s stand-up. I don't think he was any more dirty than Dave Attell or Doug Stanhope. He was honestly probably less explicit than them looking back on it. I remember seeing Rogan live in 2013 and thinking how much it just felt like a watered down Bill Burr. But you're right about being able to tell people apart from who has heard him versus who hasn't by how they mention or speak of him. Rogan hasn't changed much. I don't think he's going anywhere anytime soon but I think he's long since passed the peak of his career.\n\nI get a little nostalgic too lmao. I remember being 18, a freshman in college and listening to his first 300-400 episodes then between classes, in the car, at work, at work, or sitting at home. His episodes with Tom Segura & Christina P., Doug Stanhope, Duncan Trussell, and Bobcat Goldthwait were always my favorites. His bests were always when he got some of the old Boston/NYC comics he came up with. In hindsight, Rogan was really what got me listening to podcasts and further gave me more interest in stand-up comedy.","What happened to Peterstein? His first few podcast were pretty interesting, now he just seem off in the head, rambling away.","I think the fact that he has this rep has a lot less to do with Rogan himself and more to do with the fact that seemingly every person who\u2019s really into him is that dude you know who\u2019s very into dropping acid but who has somehow never learned from it that he should love his fellow man better than he does.","He has a whole trilogy based around college. He went to college to study art, specifically drawing","You would have thought Peterson would have developed some humility after almost dying from benzos. I guess when you get that rich and famous you're pretty much always a lost cause","> With the Jungian psycho-social analysis, though, he really shines. Some of it's a bit scatter-shot, but he's full of interesting ideas and insights.\n\nthis is what i was super into when i first heard him on there years ago. I hadn't heard of evo psych, and the idea was super interesting to me. The archetype stuff was packaged nicely as well. I know he didn't invent this stuff, but he packaged it well for a pop audience. If somebody is doing it better than peterson (hes all politics these days anyway) let me know because the hero's journey and why humans like certain stories and how that relates to how we evolved is super interesting to me.","The two Alex Jones episodes are my favourite because Joe's in a constantstate of bewilderment throughout the entire thing","I listened to the beginning so far and enjoyed his points on coastal sea life preservation and the point about poverty and uncertainty contributing to impulsiveness and a lack of short term planning. It was definitely all over the place. He has some great points and many awful points. Like I saw him on a lecture tour once a few years back (I have curiosity for cringe) and, while it was incredibly dumb and boring, he mocked the idea of wealthy people living in gated communities when they could afford to live in communities that don\u2019t require gates and how they\u2019re effectively imprisoning themselves and projecting a lack of safety. I don\u2019t take him too seriously and judge each of his points individually, like his climate science and modeling bit in the latest episode seemed uncharitable and he didn\u2019t really steel man in his criticisms.","> Like the dude got legit popular because he once roasted a feminist.\n\nHe got famous by lying about Bill C-16.

The subtext about literally everything in the show being vacuous due to it all being in service of brands and commercialism is there from the very beginning and essentially acts as a thematic frame for everything going on within it. It's really not supposed to be a focal point. It's something you acknowledge and move past as you see these characters develop and operate within that framework. The show is not about capitalism you dorks. \n\nLike sure you can call the ending cynical but that's really not anymore developed of an interpretation than what was present from the very first season. Uplifting or inspirational may be a stretch but Don basically always dissociated his work from the actual practical use of it anyways, it was always closer to an artistic exercise for him. You get to see an \"artist\" come to terms with himself and paint his masterpiece. Yes, there is some irony in that it's ultimately in service of selling sugary drinks but if that is your largest takeaway from the finale and let it color your entire reading of it then I really think you're doing a disservice to what the show is actually trying to do.","The whole arc of the last season was about whether Don could change or whether he\u2019d just end up going back to the same hollow self-destructive lifestyle forever, which, yeah, is not coincidentally the epitome of late capitalism. The last scene totally is about capitalism devouring everything, but it\u2019s up to us to decide for ourselves what that means for Don.","I fucking hate that guy","He made a really good video on contrapoints too","Shit I remember they got a bunch of live action old people IRL to play the kids like it was a documentary in the future looking back which was wacky","Pat can be unbearably petty at times and autistic, which all video essayist are.

I guess he has bleeped some shit in the past at stavs behest but scrubbing the catalogue would be both futile and cowardly.","I'm not a huge fan of solo stav either but my personal theory for why so many cum town fans have this frothing hate for him is because he really did do a good job assimilating his broader sensibilities to the show and nick's aesthetic direction, and compared to his sense of humor when he appears elsewhere on his own terms, he's always been meaner, pettier and weirder on the show.

My take on his grift is he's pretending to be David Goggins, but extremely watered down, no lived experience behind the words, no actually meaningful motivation in his speech, he's extremely arrogant and does the \"spew bullshit confidently and retards believe it\" thing and pop off on stereotypical brodog misogyny.

There would be less space for Gerda, our husky, but no more 45-minute car commutes and no more road rage. I would walk everywhere. And I would take Gerda with me.\n\nThose first morning walks were exciting for both of us. As we rounded the island\u2019s southern tip, I admired the view of the Brooklyn Bridge as Gerda lunged at scraps of food. But soon the charms of the garbage-strewn plaza in front of the Staten Island Ferry started to wear off, and the 1980s architecture of Battery Park City seemed to take on a generic look. With so much to sniff, Gerda was content, but I felt the need to fill the hours with something that would drown out the city noise and occupy my brain.A friend recommended \u201cRed Scare,\u201d a cultural commentary podcast, pointing out that it was hosted by two self-described \u201cbohemian layabouts\u201d from the former Soviet Union, Anna Khachiyan and Dasha Nekrasova. Since I\u2019m from Belarus, my friend thought the show would speak to me.\n\nWhen I was 15, my family left the Soviet Union as political refugees fleeing anti-Semitism. I made it through the local public high schools and a mediocre business college that left me with more student debt than knowledge, before I finally learned something while getting a master\u2019s degree at a liberal university. Each of my 30 years in America had gradually chipped away at my once-rosy view of my adopted home as I battled my way out of poverty, material and spiritual.\n\nPolitically, I was on the left, the Marxist teachings of my Soviet youth only strengthened by the injustices I saw during my formative years in the United States. But in the past several years I\u2019ve come to feel lonely on the political spectrum, finding moments of sanity in conversations with friends, rather than in publications that seem to favor opinion-driven pandering. Still, I looked to the news media for a reality check, hoping that someone out there must have a clue. But where do you find sanity in an insane world?\n\nWhen I started listening to \u201cRed Scare\u201d on my walks with Gerda, I felt like I had found a refreshing critique of the increasingly polarized political landscape. While situating themselves on the left, Ms. Khachiyan and Ms. Nekrasova didn\u2019t shy away from calling out the excesses of so-called progressivism. They waded into the culture wars, highlighting the absurdity and cynicism of corporate media while emphasizing that the poor always seemed to get fleeced in the end.\n\nThe hosts went after the political na\u00efvet\u00e9 of some leftists and criticized slogans like \u201cDefund the Police,\u201d noting that the police were more often than not from lower-middle-class and minority backgrounds. Ms. Khachiyan spoke highly of \u201cThe Culture of Narcissism\u201d by Christopher Lasch, one of my favorite books.On my rounds with Gerda, I came to think that the hosts shared a mature, European sensibility to go with a certain wisdom common to immigrants who have grown up without privilege and are able to see America with some clarity.\n\nI wasn\u2019t the only one enthralled with \u201cRed Scare.\u201d Patreon reports that it has roughly 12,000 supporters who collectively donate nearly $53,000 a month. Part of the show\u2019s appeal has nothing to do with politics. Mixed into their dissections of current events, the hosts frequently discuss shopping, beauty regimens and bits of celebrity gossip. The show\u2019s popularity is probably helped by the celebrity of Ms. Nekrasova, an actress who has appeared on \u201cSuccession\u201d and \u201cOnly Murders in the Building.\u201d\n\nMore often than not, I nodded along as I listened to back episodes. Gerda and I started spending more time on our walks, much to her delight, and my headphones discouraged strangers from trying to engage me in mind-numbing doggy chitchat. To celebrate her new outdoorsy lifestyle, Gerda took NASCAR-style laps around the dog run, chasing off the males who tried to hump her.\n\nBut somewhere along the way, the podcast began to grate on me. Maybe it was when Ms. Khachiyan offered a defense of Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager who fatally shot two men and wounded another during a 2020 Black Lives Matter protest in Wisconsin. (Mr. Rittenhouse was acquitted of criminal charges in 2021.) And it didn\u2019t sit well with me when Ms. Khachiyan questioned the efficacy of vaccines in the efforts to curb Covid-19, describing herself as becoming \u201can even more conservative Covid truther.\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cRed Scare\u201d had played host to favorites of the so-called dirtbag left \u2014 Slavoj Zizek, Adam Curtis and John Waters \u2014 a guest in November 2021 was Alex Jones, the founder of the misinformation website Infowars and a prominent conspiracy theorist who described the killings of 27 people, including 20 children, at the Sandy Hook Elementary School as a hoax.\n\nThe hosts were apparently trying to rehabilitate his reputation, asking him softball questions like, \u201cDo you feel like a caricature that the liberal media made you out to be?\u201d A photo posted on Ms. Nekrasova\u2019s Instagram account at the time of the interview shows the two hosts on either side of a smiling Mr. Jones, with Ms. Nekrasova\u2019s arm around him. (Late last year Mr. Jones was ordered by a court to pay the victims\u2019 families nearly $1.5 billion in damages.)\n\nMs. Khachiyan declined to comment about the apparent shift when I contacted her via email for this essay. Ms. Nekrasova did not reply to requests for comment. In a 2019 interview with The Face, the hosts complained about critics who have likened them to \u201ccrypto-fascists.\u201d \u201cThe idea that we\u2019re somehow dangerous or influencing discourse in a toxic way is unfair and misguided,\u201d Ms. Nekrasova said. Her co-host added, \u201cWe are two chicks with an entertainment radio show that you can voluntarily opt in or out of. We\u2019re not policymakers or political figures.\n\n\u201dIncreasingly, I was dismayed by what I was hearing. Did they truly believe what they were saying? Was it a function of being children of Russian-speaking immigrants, whose conservatism, often tinged with racism and anti-socialist sentiment, is commonplace and one of the reasons I couldn\u2019t wait to get out of my old Brooklyn neighborhood?On it went, along with their talk about their shopping trips and spa routines. Worst of all was the careless spouting of increasingly provocative and unsubstantiated views. I found myself stopping 20 minutes into each episode, wondering why I was wasting my time. As I fumbled with my phone, Gerda looked at me judgmentally for interrupting our walks.One day a \u201cRed Scare\u201d episode notification popped up on my phone. I hit the little x. Then I deleted the podcast.\n\nSince then I\u2019ve been mostly listening to music, which allows me to spend time with my thoughts as we navigate the narrow downtown streets. Gerda doesn\u2019t seem to mind, as long as she has something to sniff.\n\nEugene Rabkin is the editor of StyleZeitgeist magazine.","I can\u2019t imagine being self important enough to think me no longer listening to a podcast is worthy of a New York Times article","\"In the middle of the pandemic my wife and I moved to Manhattan from Brooklyn. There would be less space for Gerda, our husky, but no more 45-minute car commutes and no more road rage. I would walk everywhere.

The season 2 to season 3 drop off ruined it for me. 2 was genuinely good but 3 didn\u2019t even feel like the same show.","You\u2019re just being a contrarian because it\u2019s popular on Reddit. Season 2 was legitimately good.","Nicky is a nasty little man","It is impossible to cancel Dan Harmon, for he loathes himself more than any twitter mob ever could","i hope his buddy alex hirsch is next, he always gave creep energy","Likely the network did a little digging and found a ton of other bad stuff unrelated to his pending case and figured they better get ahead of the shit-train. \n\nIt\u2019s fine, they can pay smart writers and chalk up the change in character voices to just being a new version of the characters from a different multiverse.","Yeah he\u2019s praised it a ton. It\u2019s exactly the kind of show Nick wishes he was motivated enough to make. The inter dimensional cable improv episodes are basically just cum town bits.","Get Joel McHale to do all the voices lol","who decided that it was funny? something more sinister happening in the collective unconscious -> spreading to typically \"normcore\" spaces","9/11.","The show is like 30% trans/indian/black/ BIPOC BIWOCKS boring people getting interviewed. shits so boring lol","He's a multimillionaire political celeb,  you're not contradicting any incel talking point","Fun episode the first one I've listened all the way through to the end in a while. I know I'm an exception but I was raised mostly by my dad because my mom was the major breadwinner and led the women's union and later became secretary of education and I just find it weird when people say they're not feminists. She died of a heart attack when I was 19 so I guess maybe that's a good reason.","Larry David is that you?","This sounds hilarious and you owe it to us to remember what it was.","good, he went insane a while back","His name is Chris, does something vaguely financial that sounds more impressive than it is, he has a Twitch stream but isn't pathological about it, and the only thing he says at parties is \"nice to meet you too\"","I hate the anti Christ","A watched a couple of videos of psychiatrists reacting to a famous old video of this catatonic schizophrenic guy who was talking about how he wanted to play piano professionally. They weren't too bad.","Love him but hes wrong on this one","Hate him but hes right on this one","Man, he used to be one of my favorite Youtube channels when he was still studying to be a doctor, he was one of the best at explaining proper studying techniques and explaining the science behind them.\n\nBut then he made a video where he was like \"Yeah, I'm going to stop studying to become a doctor, I only wanted to become a doctor for clout anyways LOL\" and now all he does is dogshit \"productivity\" and passive income videos.","Todd Howard ass looking mother fucker.","It\u2019s the age of the contrarian.","Why are you deconstructing this dumb joke in a conversation like he was trying to be George Carlin","lol what's crazy is that this guy is huge with kids. Was talking to my cousin who is 9 and he loves this shit and said every kid in his class loves mr beast.  I guess it's just the today-version of cartoons in the 90s?\n\nSomething about it just seems evil though","oh this is what mr beast is? elsagate type shit","I miss being 10","it seems like he\u2019s gone to seed creatively... thank god the back-catalogue is robust. could see a pom-pom level comeback in a year or so tho","Are you Larry David?","No but I firmly believe that in every episode of Curb he's in the right.","The station to station stories are somehow funnier every time I come across them","Adam Friedland show is like as if Tim Heidecker would do a Mark Proksch show","yea that was one of the two vids I've ever watched of his. he does charitable shit, I just don't like watching poor people battle it out for money in ridiculous challenges. \n\nThe other vid I saw of his was part of a multi-part series, I think it was to win 1 mil. One of the challenges was to keep swinging on a swingset until there is one left. It came down to two young guys, a black dude and an indian dude. The black dude tries so hard to win but is clearly exhausted, at one point they even call his mom who clearly really wants him to win, they talk about his dad who has some fucked up heart that they have to shock to keep him alive, basically this dude is just keeping in there for his family. Tears rolling down his cheeks as he's swinging this entire time. The vid is getting more depressing by the second so Mr. Beast says if he gets off now he'll get a guaranteed 10k + 2% of the indian's mil if he wins (he offered). He eventually gives up as the indian is literally 1/3 his weight and could go for several more hours. Dude is weeping as they carry him off and nearly dissociates on the couch.","he's replacing the lottery and also santa claus in popular consciousness\nmr beast: the giver of gifts","when he was on tafs and put the kibosh on the theory that he was so pissed cuz the bad trumpeter was playing outside the holocaust musuem, and that really it was because of something vague about how 9/11 happened in the same borough, amazing shit","I thought it was a bit of a meme episode when I saw the thumbnail, but he turned out to be an interesting dude","The only thing I have against him is the too many men on the ice penalty in 1979.  He's only racist against Euros as far as I know and we all know that doesn't count.","you were 10 in 2011? are you a post 9/11 child??","world went to shit when they fired him","Mr. Beast is the antichrist. Keep this in mind when he's [elected president.](https://www.insider.com/mrbeast-president-mid-40s-2022-9)","It's not that his whole set or any of his talk show appearances were anti comedy, but reading from a 1950s joke book at Bob Saget's roast is basically the definition of it","I also dislike it very much. Steven Wilson singing \u201cXbox is a god to me\u201d was a last straw for me.","I hate that man.","I wouldn't call this scene \"leftist history\" because (in context) Tony is justifying his own lifestyle dishonestly.  I'm not sure if David Chase knows \"leftist history\" whatever that means, but I don't think you can really understand a theme from scenes without context.  \n\n\n(Chase has obviously read People's history of the United States. Big fan of the dopey son reading it in the show)","Why is it literally a manuscript in my case? I don't want to edit it but the pages haunt me.","If I had some preternatural drive, I would never become like Mr. Beast. Chill bro. He's obviously a drain on society. Move on with your life and stop getting your panties in a twist defending millionaire youtubers who care nothing about you. He's not gonna let you suck his dick bro","He just made a video helping 1000 blind people see again. How is that soulless lmao","I work with a guy who wants to start a youtube channel and says this guy is his favorite youtuber. Dude is probably in his 40s too.","or louis ck?","am i the only one who hates timbaland's verse in this? the teepee line especially","can't stand this twerp","modern day playboi carti and yeat fans are the same phenotype","I love watching him. Post Benzo coma he\u2019s been an absolute unhinged, over emotional psycho and it\u2019s hilarious to watch.","I want to find this guy, deflate every ballon he\u2019s ever used to make his shitty IRL tweet and shove it up his ass.","I find some of his stuff mildly amusing. But imagine being that guy and that\u2019s your whole thing. I guess there\u2019s worse situations out there.",],

Them complaining about freedom of speech existing while posting communist leaders holding trans flags is funny though.","My ex exclusively used they/them pronouns and had a tumblr blog where they would draw Disney princesses making out.","At my local music store they have all of the employees put pronouns on a piece of paper.

A lot of people disagree with how to write gendered words in a nb level tho, so that\u2019s nice.","The pronouns thing always seems a little weird on twitter because Twitter is almost always direct communication so the default is 2nd person ( YOU suck. YOU are being retarded. YOUR art is terrible. etc.)\n\nIf you are referring to people in the 3rd person, just use their name (DASHA is smart and hot. ELLA shouldn't be a model. etc)\n\nI don't intentionally misgender trans people because I'm not a dick, but I'm not playing ball with non-standard pronouns or whatever non-binary nonsense these cunts want try.","No one else needs to. \n\nA nb of color is gonna be legit.","Damn!! this is doing numbers, y\u2019all mind if I link my Venmo?","Cope and seethe she/her","This is particularly baffling to me, like sex is not something you're entitled to to start with so you should really just be gracious and handle it on a personal level - regardless of whether you're NB or trans or not.","I mean, its nothing special. I hear and assume that its slower paced than alot of places, but with covid that doesnt mean much. Its not bad tho, although i mostly just keep to myself.","this should be illegal","Every upvote = 1 fat person who posts here.  \nEvery downvote = 1 lying fat person who posts here.  \nEvery not vote = the hottest motherfuckers on the subreddit.","nahhh fph only got banned because I believe they started doxxing their own fat employees / colleagues at imgur.","Reels posting on insta","Lmao this reminds me of the time I brought a whiteclaw to my own firing.","Strong lizard person energy","Not Fat > HR > Obese < HR < Fat\n\nBecause Donuts and sweet coffee being marketed as breakfast doesn't mean you can start each day with fucking cake and milkshakes.","If HR was meant to keep women from getting fat it definitely isn't working.","(it was unopened and up their ass)","Or on your zoom call repeatedly cup your hands over your mouth and go \"kkkkrrrrssshhh!\" sorry we're breaking up I'm going through a tunnel and don't acknowledge anything they say to you","MemriTV has to be the funniest Israeli propaganda outfit ever.

It's the slav. Like I'm not exactly slavic but there's definitely intermingling and mental illness gallops through the slavic gene pool. It's cool though so long as you don't get the asymmetric face genes but damn are slavic people crazy. Like, one of my aunts legit believed she had magical powers which shows how gadjified my family has become in America like she had a book of spells written in English no less when she died.

I think you\u2019re just hesitant to see it that way because the present consequences of unchecked hedonism and individualism engendered a tendency toward mindless consumerism and certain myopic obsession with personal identity (idpol), which is, as you say, practically the opposite of thelemic values, but even so our current lifestyles more resemble the pursuit of true will than they did back when it was a crime to be gay and everyone, even atheists, kowtowed to the cultural dominance of Abrahamic religious values \n\nI\u2019ll concede that it\u2019s more accurate to say Crowley predicted the direction of cultural zeitgeist rather than his works influencing its manifestation, but if you are a true believer in maaaagic(k) I think it would be remiss to dismiss the notion entirely.

A lot of these are almost great but suffer from post processing and minor composition issues. A few more years and you'll be doing some solid work.\n\nI can be more specific in critique if you want for specific images. My professional work is post processing related but I've been taking photos for nearing two decades.\n\nWhat lenses are you mostly shooting on? A lot of these would benefit from just a slightly wider lens or walking backwards 10-20ft.","Various entrances to the black lodge","Some are in Michigan I think. The Jiffy Factory in particular is in Chelsea, Michigan","There\u2019s a reason why tourists from around the world come to tour the American southwest.","Very quick thoughts. Please just take these as suggestions and not law or targeted criticism. I don't know the environment you were in, what you were trying to achieve, your style, etc. These are just things I notice from having looked at or worked on tens of thousands of images over the years. I'm also going to update this post with some very rough post processing tweaks I did quickly on my phone.\n\nIn general, you have a good eye for scenes and a strong sense of color which is good as those are the two hardest things to teach. Post processing can be taught and composition can be refined as you practice and gain experience. In general, as I mentioned, a lot of these images would benefit from taking a few more minutes walking around slightly to better line up your shot. Some examples: \n\n1) This is your strongest shot and the colors + the window are really great. I would've moved slightly to lose the tree in the top right though you can do that easily in post processing (a no no in docco photography but when I take a picture I know what I want it to look like and I'm going to edit it to achieve that, disregard if this is not your ethos and just be careful with composition before you press the shutter). Shifting slightly to the left (just a little) would also better bring the left most telephone pole over to balance the image--it'd be nice to see a tiny bit more of that house to the left too to give it breathing room. We wouldn't lose anything of interest on the right side of frame. I like that you shot the house slightly off center, there's always a tendency to make photos too tableaux and it's good to fight that until later in your career. Post processing wise i think most of your images would benefit from a little less crunch in your blacks. Open up those shadows and the whole image can breathe better. I'd add a little exposure to the house so it pops more and maybe bring down the highlights on the top of the saturated cloud just a tiny bit as it looks a little hot and near chroma clipping.\n\n[Quick edit](https://i.imgur.com/VZC1cQQ.jpg)\n\n2) Great mood. I like the thought you're doing with the tanks and the gas station composition but it feels like it could've been lined up a little better to really emphasize the stairstep and maybe play with the porta potty to the frame right. I think the highlights are a little hot, especially in the clouds over the mountain and in general the image needs some rotation or perspective warping to feel properly settled. In terms of detailed composition, I think something feels off to me in terms of image depth, you need either a longer or shorter lens but this normal perspective isn't helping the image pop.\n\n3) I think this is one of your better compositions and the monochromacity is interesting. I'd slightly tweak the perspective tilt and maybe play with highlights on the buildings but overall very solid. \n\n4) Ignoring the obvious image alignment rotation issues, again I think you've identified an incredible scene: this old camaro in a lonely parking lot with that vista behind. However, I don't think this your best composition of the moment. The light is really nice in the sky right here with those shadows in the parking lot and I think you could better integrate that into the composition. There's too much detail in those scrubby trees and while there's not much you can do with that itself, you can balance it with the featurless cement and sky. If you had walked backwards (and I know there's probably other vehicles here making it impossible) and shot the car from farther back with sky above those trees and a big blank parking lot on the bottom of frame, you'd have a really well composed moment of barren featurelessness, life and decay, and the empty sky above.\n\n5) Another one of your bests. The wires really complement this composition and the house and barn are great. However there is tension (and not in a good way) against the tree half cropped out frame left and the field frame right. You either need to back up or pan left or right to better integrate or remove that tree and the field as it's not standing strong on its own. Processing wise I like the clamped tonality and don't have any major suggestions but will post a little mock up of an alternative but similar direction you could also explore.\n\n[Quick alt edit](https://i.imgur.com/MdXWjIL.jpg)\n\n6) This is one of the weaker images though there are nice elements. The colors are strong and you've identified a really strong mood. However, there really isn't a strong composition here as there's nothing compelling beyond those things (and they are nice so I understand the urge to take this shot). A lot of the time I find myself exploring a location knowing the lighting and color are perfect, but if you can't find that anchor for the shot then you have to pass it up. Here there's too much cinderblock on the right, not enough space for the car on the left, the highlights are gone in those sources (not your fault but you can soften the effect by adding bloom), too much chroma in the sign, and your reds have gone fairly pink in a harsh digital way that doesn't feel natural. Again, the mood is great, but this composition isn't doing it justice and I don't think that's your fault but a reality of \"street\" photography just not working out sometimes.\n\n7) I think this is the weakest image of the bunch. Again, there's no compositional center to anchor us. The counter and display on the left is too dominant, there's too much wall on and cieling in the top and middle left, we can't see the shopkeeper behind the bottles, and the man in the vest who could've been our anchor is standing just a little bit too far back. I think this would've been stronger if you took two steps to the left and centered up on the vest guy some providing more depth by increasing the angle on the left counter and also emphasizing those amazing ceiling fluorescents with the american signs hanging. Post processing wise this is too contrast in the shadows, lift them up!\n\nI'll continue in another post.","Fargo S2.","David Lynch vibe","The magnetic packer schedule in the pic of the inside of Bernie\u2019s fine meats makes me feel at home","Excellent framing, lighting, contrast, etc. I'm assuming you've had some professional training?","Im a professional proofreader and i felt it","I feel like I asked you this before but do you travel around like a vagabond or something?","Go to Eureka. \n\nYou'll find this.","Has there been a single logo change in the past 10 years that's been good???","Can we stop with the plain text","do you work in the industry because it does not work like that at all\n\na logo is a huge deal and is not allowed to be changed by some intern","Coca Cola\u2019s logo was pure class to begin with.

It was not in any way the fruit of individual sex-love, with which it had nothing whatever to do; marriages remained as before marriages of convenience. **It was the first form of the family to be based, not on natural, but on economic conditions \u2013 on the victory of private property over primitive, natural communal property.** The Greeks themselves put the matter quite frankly: the sole exclusive aims of monogamous marriage were to make the man supreme in the family, and to propagate, as the future heirs to his wealth, children indisputably his own. Otherwise, marriage was a burden, a duty which had to be performed, whether one liked it or not, to gods, state, and one\u2019s ancestors. In Athens the law exacted from the man not only marriage but also the performance of a minimum of so-called conjugal duties.\n\n>Thus when monogamous marriage first makes its appearance in history, it is not as the reconciliation of man and woman, still less as the highest form of such a reconciliation. Quite the contrary. Monogamous marriage comes on the scene as the subjugation of the one sex by the other; it announces a struggle between the sexes unknown throughout the whole previous prehistoric period.\n\n[Frederick Engels, Origins of the Family, Private Property, and the State, Chapter 2, 4.

On the surface, it seems like even the highest brass at the DOD don't even know what's going on. Edging more into schizo territory, you get into some anecdotal reports that sightings have occurred near nuclear test sights in the past; that officers have reported countless sightings over the past half century, but nothing came of them due to a cold war code of silence to prevent stoking  public fears about the soviets. Turn up the schizo dial a bit more and you'll find that the highest levels of the DOD might staffed by an evangelical sect that is willfully ignorant, making restricted access programs as cloistered and inaccessible as possible because they believe it's all demons. If you go full blown shizo, there's some gnostic theories about evil alien demiurges, recovered UFOS, etc. Reading into all of this is a potent schizophrenia simulator, like microdosing the frame of mind one has after pulling 3 consecutive all nighters.

It's also easier to trick yourself into hydrating when you're a few too many deep","This has to be a troll comment, there\u2019s no way someone can be so retarded as to think alcoholics don\u2019t understand why people get drunk.","A can does not replace a bottle, the main purpose of a bottle is to be able to re seal it and throw it in a bag/carry it without worrying about it spilling. Once you open a can you can't re-seal it so it's actually replacing a normal glass of water and is therefore more wasteful than it's actual alternative. The only setting I could see this being used is at events or festivals but even then most of those now have those plastic reusable cups that you pay for and they give you back the 2$ when you bring them back, which again is less wasteful than a single use can.","I like it, its mountain water and tastes great\nAnd perfect size just enough so it doesn\u2019t go flat","you don\u2019t understand why people wouldn\u2019t report sexual assault if they and their friends  will be punished for drinking? are you fucking ret@rded?","You forgot alcoholic.

This isn't unusual. I got a hefty wokescold from a \"transgender they/them\" that was a biological female (also presented as such) in a heterosexual relationship with a biological male.

text: ["That's why it didn't really phase me. I knew what they were trying to do, and ultimately felt compassion for a person that has never felt like they've had any control over any situation in their life. Must be hard walking around all the time and not like the person you are. I'm quite fond of myself and the life I've built.","Eh. It manifested that way, but I'd just say she is miserable. It makes people like that easier to stomach. I've been taking the \"oh bless your heart\" attitude towards these types of people for years and it helps make all this shit a lot less personal.","Often when I'm confronted by someone like that, I tell myself if I lived their life I'd probably have the same views as them.","I\u2019m taking the international students into account which take up a big portion of the amount of students.","At least 50% of office workers belong under a bridge begging for scraps.","A lot of them also imagine themselves as soon to be billionaires.","Manlets, take heart.\n\nThe rich and famous envy you!","Had to yell at my mom & tell her it's normal to want to die all the time & that it's bullshit that the dude in TV gets to write about how he's depressed cuz he doesn't get to go to fuckin golf course... Meanwhile, I break my fuckin back to scrounge up enough money for food & rent","um actually my perspective on my family and upbringing is more important than the reality","You could talk about how that fact is a revelation in a society where the class system is constantly downplayed and overlooked (to the benefit of the ruling class), or you could look down your nose at the feelings one experiences when they get a glimpse behind the curtain for the first time. Your call \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af","He applied to Columbia University as a \u201cforeign national\u201d student.  \n\nWhy do you think that is?","While sometimes true, is actually kinda bad for recovery. Working more towards mental health may redirect creative energies, but it's myth that pathos is the only path to genius. The candle that burns twice as bright, burns half as long.\n\nAt least that's what I keep telling myself","Imagine if a smart person got a relatively nurturing childhood but got hit in the head a bunch and took a few too many drugs.","Remember when Zoe Kazan described her parents as \"upper middle class\"?","People who are rich don't think they're rich.","this is how class consciousness comes to the twitter class","what do you consider upper class, like from what income. i'm being serious","Millionaires are upper class","What do you think upper middle class is? In my book that\u2019s the class inhabited by doctors, lawyers, programmers, investment bankers, etc. who earn their money from salary not ownership and still need to provide some form of labor to earn an income. In a city like nyc dc or Boston that\u2019s $250k to $1mm a year in salary and certainly millionaire in terms of net worth. For context there were teachers at my public school who earned $150k a year, meaning two would have a family income of $300k with millionaire status certainly attainable. I definitely wouldn\u2019t include public school teachers in the upper class, though. That level of wealth pales in comparison to the actual upper class for whom income is entirely from capital gains and dividends/interest payments.","with inflation, a million dollars is really not a lot anymore. probably not poor, but definitely not comfortable. houses, cars, holidays, pets, personal staff -it all adds up","I'm not American so I have no idea about incomes over there.","Hearing kids in college dismiss 100k salaries in discussions about money really put things in perspective for me.","\"Middle-class\" is a constantly shifting construct, but 50K/year is not \"actually poor\" unless you live in like NYC or SF. It's above the gdp/capita for almost every western country not named America, and ~20K higher than median American income.\n\nCheck the data before reking yourself like this over and over..","I think just how many figures your parents rake in every year and also how many figures you rake in would do it\n\nspecifying low middle and high range of those figures which should be self explanatory","I assumed it\u2019s hyperbole. There are only 2,755 billionaires scattered throughout the world. Hard to imagine a classroom full of billionaires\u2019 children anywhere.","The cost of personal staff must be a real burden on millionaires, I feel so bad for them :(","why do you know so many people on such a low income. i'm not being a dick, what are the material conditions in your opinion that lead to people being content with a salary that wouldn't even get them a mortgage in most cities.","That just shows how utterly ruthless the real estate market is, and how useless and disconnected the mythos of the \"middle class\" is from present reality.\n\nThere's nothing \"middle\" about a state of living that's inaccessible to 95% of the global population.\n\nI imagine it is quite possible to be a homeowner on 50K/yr in places in the american midwest and southeast though (not big cities obviously).","Cause I grew up poor lol. Wtf do you want me to say? A ton of people in this country make a lot less than 50k, a lot less. 50k is a huge boon compared to minimum wage where I live. Also, 50k is def enough to afford to be a homeowner where I live.","so they're a class above the upper class? i'm trying to figure out how you ppl see the world","\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 Yeah I guess they're just too dumb and poor to have similar thought processes. \n\nOkay I'll stop with the teasing, but come on! Very few people actively choose to live like that. A lot of people have no choice due to life circumstances (health, disability, dependents, criminal records, education, skill, lack of opportunities/access etc), there are a myriad of reasons. Also a lot of these people are actively trying their hardest to improve their situation in life.","People are so deluded about wealth. My friend makes 200k/yr and says he's middle class. Growing up I had friends who lived in McMansions and got new cars at 16 but insisted they came from middle class parents. It's bonkers how out of touch people are.","! rich kid alert !","Dude, its clear they went to school with all Epsteins illegitimate kids!!!\n\nBut really, they probably went to a private school with a bunch of people who are the children off highly successful parents but aren't actually billionaires. In the DC metro, the rich kids go to like Sidwell Friends or Georgettown Prep. I imagine that for someone who is merely rich, not wealthy would feel like everyone around you is a billionaire","To me this is the key! I have a toddler and a wife that\u2019s able to work from home. This shit is still insanely difficult. When my mom was my age she had 3 kids ages 10-15 and divorced for 10 years. It was a constant fucking grind my whole life up until I met my wife and we were able to combine incomes.","There is such a massive difference between well paid professional and absurdly wealthy.

Having a baby is not a walk in the park, wanted or unwanted. Just because we live in the \"modern age\" doesnt mean anything - it is probably still one of the riskier things a woman can go through in their lifetime.

And they are the best kids so anyone who is against IVF can go fuck themselves","Coming from a rural southern area, the older I get the more pro-choice I get. I worked retail for many years and anytime a coworker had a baby, I felt bad for them. Some of them where taking classes at the local community college or trade school. Getting pregnant meant they had to drop out. They had to work as much as they could because babies are expensive. They didn\u2019t go back after the baby was born because child care is expensive. \n\nYears later, many are still at the same store working poverty wages. Many are stuck in that rural shithole because they rely on family to watch their kid when they are at work. They can\u2019t afford to move to an area with more opportunities because of this. \n\nParenthood really is optional for men. Many of these women don\u2019t get child support. The father will get an cash only job or come up with some bs excuse to avoid paying. \n\nMotherhood seems like hell. I\u2019m very thankful I never had a kid.

They don\u2019t care if we suffer. They don\u2019t care if we die. We deserve \u201cconsequences\u201d for engaging in any type of sexual active (consensual or not).","Do you know why PPD happens? If women have gone through it for millennia after giving birth, it seems like a pretty big failing on evolution's part, and it wouldn't surprise me if it was a consequence of a litigious western society where no one shows affection to each other and everyone believes in boostraps.","Yep. If you make it through the pregnancy, delivery is a crapshoot as to whether you'll have life-altering consequences of this \"natural process.\" I hate hearing the \"your body was made to do this\" mantra because, yes, your body will do what it can do make it to reproduction, but evolution doesn't care about what sort of maiming happens on the way out.","My wife was in labor for 18 hours when she gave birth last year. She maxed out the epidural allotment within about an hour after she was fully dilated and my son was beginning to come out. All I could do was sit there staring at her the whole time while she breathed in silence with tears coming down her face from the pain. Doctor also had to make a cut on her vagina because my big ass head genes passed down to my son, and he wasn't able to come out safely otherwise.\n\nThankfully everything turned out alright from there, but the pregnancy was a difficult ordeal and the delivery was the most pain my wife has ever felt according to her. The idea of forcing a 10 year old girl to go through that, knowing her body is much smaller and would likely have complications, is sickening. Not to mention the kid born would be some rape baby that would never be loved or properly cared for in the first place, most likely ending up in shitty foster care.\n\nAlso we got a 10k bill for the delivery a month later, we have good insurance too. God bless America.","I\u2019ve definitely gotten more pro-choice over time. I had a baby at 18 and never even considered having an abortion but as I\u2019ve gotten older I\u2019ve realized I was very lucky to have things turn out well for me (I have a bachelor\u2019s, leveraged that into a very successful career, married with more kids, own a home, etc.) But I\u2019m absolutely an anomaly. As I\u2019ve gotten older I realized exactly how much had to go right and how much support I needed to be a success despite being a single teen mom. I don\u2019t regret having my daughter and love that she\u2019s here in the world (she\u2019s seriously brilliant and it\u2019s so fun to have a teenager, not even joking). But, I can see now that my choice to be a mom definitely made life a lot harder for me in my late teens to mid-20\u2019s. And I can see how unplanned parenthood at that time could 100% derail someone\u2019s life if they had even a fraction less support and resources than I had. So my position on the issue of abortion has morphed quite a bit due to those realizations. \n\nI have an aunt in her late 60\u2019s who is SO wise and cool and a few years ago during a discussion about a hot-button issue she told me, \u201cHoney, almost nothing is black and white. It is ALL shades of grey.\u201d And the older I get the more I see that this is true! Even on the topic of abortion - which I used to view in a super black and white way.","I believe it is both.\n\nA woman's brain goes through three changes: puberty, pregnancy/postpartum and perimenopause. A man's brain only changes through puberty. Her hormones have changed constantly through pregnancy, postpartum and everytime she nurses. The body does what it needs to do to reproduce. There is no promise in nature that it will make reproduction easy for any creature - only that it must happen. \n\nThere is a LOT of physiological changes that are occurring. I believe that the core of PPD and related disorders are all rooted in these brain and hormone changes and issues would be seen globally across cultures, although treated differently within them.\n\nOn top of that she is under extreme stress, pain and sleeplessness. Our culture is very cruel, invalidating and isolating to mother's. If one were to try to reach out and get help she may have a hard time finding the time and the money to do so. There is a lot of shame involved because of the mythologies of motherhood we have created - our culture definitely exasperates things in a myriad of ways but no I don't think PPD is just some made up, I strongly believe it is rooted in actual physiological changes.","I was in an outpatient program with a woman who had postpartum psychosis and it has been my nightmare ever since. It had been a few years and she was doing better but hearing the suffering she went through was terrifying. I am pretty seriously mentally ill and I manage it ok.

I fear it wouldn\u2019t be pretty.","I agree and I am always so puzzled when I read threads on here about birth rates lowering  and how there\u2019s so many ppl on here saying more women need to have children (I get it ppl here want to be contrarian and not associated with child free mentalities) \u2026. Pregnancy / childbirth is no joke.","Fuck no. The post keeps saying \"woman\" as though women are the only people who can get pregnant.

I agree with the general premise that a lot of teens are probably picking this up as a phase, but, there\u2019s still plenty of adults who have latched to the identity.","I totally agree with that, to a point. The OP is talking about the widespread phenomenon of \"i know who i am as a person, and i don't want kids\" being suddenly turned on its head for one reason or another. I've seen it happen in my own life probably 20 times at least.","Lol no. I knew I'd have kids pretty much from when I understood the concept.","Nah you\u2019re just getting older and panicking about missing out if you don\u2019t have kids. Signed, a childless older woman","Yah man I oscillate between having baby fever and being like \u201ckids are too much\u201d depending on if I\u2019m in love or not","Didn\u2019t wanna have kids up until I got with my ex in 2017. Man gave me baby fever. I am now 24.","Its probably less hormones and more one or several of the following:\n- getting older and spending more and more years away from your family, making you realise how nice and comfortable \u2018family life\u2019 can be.\n- your parents getting older and you start feeling some degree of guilt about not \u2018repaying them\u2019 with grandchildren \n- suddenly finding yourself in a stable relationship with enough income to give a child a good upbringing \n- your peers start having kids and seem happy\n- biological clock ticking away","This might be offensive but as a woman it\u2019s your genetic responsibility to have children, I\u2019m glad you found your mate.","I think this mostly happens to women who decided against having children whilst doing exactly zero research on what childbirth and childcare is really like, so their minds are easily swayed.\n\nAlso, the fact that so many of you think suddenly developing a desire to have children is a part of \"getting older\" is hilarious. The only thing \"getting older\" has done in my case is convince me that having children is an absolutely terrible idea.","Having children isn\u2019t unethical in any way, that\u2019s liberal dogma.  Everyone should do what\u2019s right for them, but the notion that having a child is in any way unethical is insane.","Isn't it more of a yes and no situation than that? First, they lend themselves to an increased likelihood of cancer and other diseases, and then there's the whole cratering human fertility thing that Dr Shana Swan has documented.",],

text: ["white bourg shitlib guilt","lollll yeah, buying from black owned businesses as a means to \"fix\" \"systemic\" racism: r word. buying from black owned businesses is probably the least a single individual could do as a means of reparations (or whatever you want to call it) without giving in to the \"drop me $ in my venmo or you're a white pos  perpetuating systemic racism towards me\" crowd ... that seems reasonable to me. i don't think it necessarily equates to buying more shit either, but maybe looking up alternative restaurants/bakeries/shops that you were going to patronize anyway","Or particularly African American culturally. Like if a guy named Vladimir Veraskonzy became president and everyone was like \u201cHe is viht comrade, he is just like you\u201d.","I mean is black culture really conducive to creating successful politicians?","Ooooh I wasn\u2019t even thinking of all that. I thought you just referring to posting the screenshot of the interview as inherently racist. \nAs to everything else you said, I agree.","Just wondering how many actual black people are making these comments as a black man that is...","I\u2019m white, gen z, and nb. I have 4 siblings and 5 step-siblings. I too was roasted growing up, yet it still bothers me when people misgender me. It\u2019s not about having thin skin or being easily offended, misgendering someone is a way of intentionally bringing up traumatic memories. \n\nLike if you call a black person the n-word, you\u2019re invoking 250 years of racial oppression. Chances are the person you\u2019re saying it to has had negative experiences being called the n-word in the past. They\u2019re going to have a negative response.\n\nIt\u2019s the same with misgendering trans people. You\u2019re using a word against someone that is meant to ridicule and shame them. It\u2019s more complicated to keep track of, because the word \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe\u201d isn\u2019t a slur on it\u2019s own, but using it in context  has the same effect. \n\nI\u2019d categorize it with words like \u201cmonkey\u201d or \u201cfruit\u201d. Without context they\u2019re just nouns, but they become racist/homophobic when used in a specific way.","Gotta say, outside of the Chris Rock bit, wealthy black people hardly ever call poor black people the n-word.","What\u2019s hilarious about that woke logic is that, don\u2019t African Americans have like 20% European DNA on average, mostly English?. (I\u2019m not from US so I may be wrong). If that\u2019s the case they could have ancestors that directly oppressed many Irish Americans ancestors.","Actually higher, closer to 30%. Lots of rape yo. \n\nFun fact: I also have white dna Bc of colonialism. British rape made my skin burn last summer \ud83d\ude20 the queen owes me reparations for my future skin cancer","What if I spanked my girl red right before the showing? Is that racist to Native Americans? \n\n\"She's wearing red-ass!\"","No, I don't think black people deserve credit for that either?","POV you talked to a white libtard w*mxn","Kinda true there are black girls (who are also shafted on the dating \"market\") though it should be said that black girls are are pretty own-race centric too","I have noticed that East Asian men are dating non-Asian women at higher rates than before, but not South Asian men.","same but about POC in regards to white people","> Only Whites face repercussions enough to fake a value system for societal approval.\n\n\n\none form is system approved and enforced, the other isn't. that's the difference.","Ok but there is an explosion in black on Asian attacks so they\u2019re not totally wrong to be wary.","anti racist? feels like that should be a given and not something you have to clarify","So there was a tunnel where you get to yell slurs at white women and you didn't invite me? Eat shit and die","True. I also was called a nigger to my face during the pandemic doing someone's taxes so it goes both ways.","Not so much anymore (at least against the secular crowd), but Jews weren\u2019t really considered \u201cwhite\u201d until the 50s or 60s.\n\nAlso it\u2019s not that hard to find someone saying some heinous shit about Jews, but I suppose all sorts of people say heinous shit about other groups of people all the time.","It\u2019s like Latino which can men and women while latinas just means women.","This is racism against Midwesterners","There's pretty white women everywhere, if only YE can open YER eyes","Ok and why exactly did they immigrate..","Last one not middle eastern, it\u2019s hispanic","They have nothing on the white expats who emigrate to East and South East Asia.","They\u2019re oppressed in America by virtue of being both women and of color.","There has never been a Jewish president. Jews are exactly as overrepresented as Asians in the upper middle class because Jews tend to study","White?","Reminds me of the white women in Austin coming up to my black friend and being like \"Yass Queen that dress looks so good on that black body\".\n\nUnironically, and it's happened several times.","Nice cherry picking, all 10 joes cabinet members are jewish","This seems so clear every time a thread about a south american country comes up in the worldnews sub and it's a bunch of perfect english \"venezuelans\" or \"chileans\" talking about the horrors of fuel subsidies for poor people or whatever.","ok the fact im not white is a bit","This is such a white woman thing to say.","right like the only person who actually complains about this is white women LOL","White woman or knight alert","Fair, but also, white women are uniquely offputting and irritating, and when I say this, I am most often talking about them specifically.","That\u2019s a white woman issue","Yeah, this is kind of it. It was specifically a response to white women trying to align themselves to the struggles of ethnic minorities by singling out white men, as if they didn't share their privilege. But at this point, it's mostly just veiled universal misogyny.","it appeals to the aggrieved redditor who believes white people are unfairly treated because it's socially acceptable to criticize them while  minorities get to counter with accusations of racism.","Why do only white women get fibromyalgia, though?","White woman the only ones saying this.","white women are the most women of women","Is this like a white people thing?","Whites are like the samurai class though, only they\u2019re allowed to practice football and carry cleats","Idk like 4 or 5 from college. And they all called themselves white btw (none of them were)","> whites are into rugby,\n\nThe Polynesian Bull is coming for them, be afraid.","Mestizos are mostly European though\n\n\"Within the population totals, there may be an imprecise amount of mixed population. In one of the most comprehensive genetic studies involving the population of Argentina, 441 Argentines from across the North East, North West, Southern, and Central provinces (especially the urban conglomeration of Buenos Aires) of the country, it was observed that the sample population comprised on average of 65% European, followed by 31% Amerindian, and finally 4% of African ancestry; however, this study was unweighted and meant to be a representation of the diversity of Argentine DNA rather than a demonstration of the average ethnic composition of the country. It was also found there were great differences in the ancestry amongst Argentines as one traveled across the country. A study by Daniel Corach that attempted to find the average Argentine ancestry by **weighing the population of various regions gave a significantly higher estimate of European ancestry at 78.5% of the average Argentine's autosomal DNA**.\"","Yeah and some of them came over in the late 40\u2019s for reasons we won\u2019t go into","are they the whitest south americans?","According to who? According to themselves most are white. According to me as a Swede observing them they are mostly white (southern European). This is like saying Afro-Americans aren't black because they have 20-25% of white European in them.","According to the people who invented the concept of whiteness lol. A lot of southern Europeans aren\u2019t white either, they\u2019re mixed with North African, Turkish, etc. And no, it\u2019s not like saying that. That\u2019s what the one drop rule means, if you\u2019re not 100% Northern European you\u2019re not white.","Actually the concept of whiteness was imvented by Spain to diferentate themselves and other europeans from the indians and blacks in the colonies. The anglos copied it but made It much more intolerant to mixings","Yeah, but probably tied with the other Southern Cone countries of ~~Chile~~ and Uruguay.\n\nThey had relatively little African slavery, plus a large infusion of European immigration in the late 1800s, early 1900s. Half of Argentines are like basically full-blooded Italians. And the reason so many Nazis fled to Argentina after WW2 was because there was already an existing German immigrant community there since the 1800s.","I think Uruguayans are a little more white, but they come in as a close second. Chileans are certainly much less white than the Argentines.","the ones who get indignant and have to go \"ackshually latinos can be white too\"","Bit racististic","Definitely Asian","you're talking about poor white people","I don\u2019t think their being White is a big deal. Imagine this photo but with a sleek and slim French family drinking red wine and reading hardback books.","My favourite was when Pelosi told people to go hug Asian people in china town to show racism bad.","I apologize for like, racism and shit.","\u201cWhite people be _______\u201d. Every race and every gender is the same shit. Why do we always act like white people are inherently worse.","...but why would white Hollywood actors take responsibility for black kids slaughtering other black kids?","...why would they have parsed it down to \"white Democrats\"?  \nif people are really that fucking ignorant (and surely they are), wouldn't about half of *all* Democrats believe that?  \nand surely black (Democrats) would be even likelier to swallow a stat as ridiculous as that...despite, if they actually thought about it, easily being able to realize that they themselves knew far more black men who died in car wrecks than ones who were killed by police.","it's because 8 out of 10 Black people believe it, so it was statistically significant to separate the two.","*dayum.*    \n\ni mean, i've heard black people go to \"that's 'cause y'all racist\" my whole life; and in former times, it was just tacitly agreed that the white people just doing their jobs would roll their eyes and ignore it, and the black people, who knew it was bullshit, would go \"well, that didn't work\" and move on.  \nbut now the media has brainwashed people to the point of having to sift through every one of these pieces of bullshit like they were bomb threats at an elementary school...and the extent to which this has emboldened young black people is insane.  \n\n[cue Louis Theroux going, \"you don't really believe that, do you, LeTravian? ...how could that be true? just think about how many people die in car accidents.\"]","She did it in response to learning that someone asked what colour the baby would be\n\nMy brother is dating a white girl and if they ever have kids that question will undoubtedly be asked by my family.

I thought it was a cultural identity?\n\nIf you can't speak Spanish and you're not visibly indigenous, then how is being \"Hispanic\" different to being \"Polish-American\" or some other identity?","I\u2019ve noticed a lot of racist non-white people will just assume that white people agree with their particular racial bias. I used to work at an auto parts store in a very international part of Houston, and customers would always say racist shit to me about other customers or employees. Once had a Japanese woman explain that she didn\u2019t want to deal with my boss cuz she could tell he\u2019s Cambodian, and \u201cCambodians are the Asian n****rs.\u201d","from what ive observed at my last 2 jobs and living in a pretty diverse area, there is a definite difference between how black people are treated vc other people of color, especially professionally and academically","it\u2019s just so strange (source: am black) we either get treated like social pariahs or artificially uplifted and tokenized (black girl magic girlbossery)\u2026it\u2019s just so demeaning and humiliating","I've noticed this since forever\n\nWhite and/or POC girl endlessly posting/talking about hating white rapey frat bros but has had only pasty white BF's the entire time.

The kids\u2019ll be alright.\n  \nPeople get mad at gender stuff for the same reason meat eaters get mad at vegans. Insecurity with their own constructed identity, lashing out at something new like a caveman etc. I just don\u2019t see how it\u2019s that big of a deal.","Also testosterone reduces anxiety as a side effect.

I'm gay so the ones in gay circles I've always known and befriended have been the ones who date men. They want to pass as much as they possibly can, and live their lives like regular women. Seems to me that the controversial ones we always hear about are a subset of the \"lesbian\" ones who don't make as much effort to pass or to be conventionally feminine. Anyway, that's just my impression.","Trans women should model themselves after Regina imo","i can\u2019t think of a better word than grotesque. yeah trans rights and whatever, but it\u2019s aesthetically discordant \u2014 an obese woman in a petite outfit or an mtf wearing hyperfeminine clothes.\n\n\nit reminds me of reading about submissive men who see dominatrixes, and how all the men hold power (cops, congressmen, ceos) and how all the women were poor. the dominatrix fantasy is fake but they have to pretend","Yea, everyone is fine with that.

Self harm as a result of insecurity. \n\nI don't see people rejecting others right to do with themselves and express themselves in any way they want. I see people refusing them the right to change the world around them to fit their decisions. That is not a right.

Short stature, narrow frame, weak jawline, pear shape, relative hairlessness etc. are all things you can find in males.

I think one of the first live shows did it as a feature.","Agreed, but don\u2019t tell Anna though","Who's Anna and Dash?","On occasion, I will accidentally hear Anna's voice, and I'm always surprised.","Me, take a hike nana.","Holy fucking shit. Dasha is really trying to get all her scenes cut from succession.","Dasha so cute. Anna looking hot too. Damn I wanna smooch these chicks.","Watch the All Gas No Brakes episode on Midwest Furfest. There\u2019s a cracked out girl there dressed as a \u201cwitten\u201d (wolf kitten lmfao) in a sailor costume. Apparently she was like a Dasha replyguy on twitter or smthn and they beefed a little. After the breakup Adam flew her out to his and they hooked up, internet found out because she posted a selfie in his mirror that Dasha had posted selfies in. Witten girl was super weird after lol. Dash talks vaguely about the sitch in the Not Really Red Scare premium episode with Sandberg and Cupo","How do I become a cohost on this show and marry Dasha at the same time? I think I might be your only straight male listener. That should be qualifications enough, ya know?","you have to upvote it every time dasha changes identities or it doesn't work","Dasha looks young but she's still ugly af","Jen Kirkman disease. Saw her do a pop up show in LA in 2014 she had the whole place cry-laughing and then immediately the next year her brain rotted out of her skull on twitter and she's been a hollow body ever since.","Dasha is a beautiful 31 year old woman. I can\u2019t understand why she would rather adopt the mannerisms of a young girl than be who she is. It looks really fake and pathetic. It also screams insecurity and you really get the sense that her persona was created by looking into the front camera of a smartphone. At the same time, she is really breaking the rules for how a celeb is supposed to be and that\u2019s interesting to watch in this clip.","thank you, this is so true. dasha, i will let you be happy. forgive me","If Dasha ever commits a heinous crime this is the footage they'd use in the documentary overlayed with ominous music.","I thought Anna was the taller of the two at 5\u20197. Dasha is 5\u20194.","Aww, Dasha\u2019s excited little hands. \ud83d\ude0a","As much her entire Succession salary could have bought.","This is a sign (that Dasha should go brunette)","Dasha knew the camera was on her and chose to steal the show with this silent tour de force. She needs a new stylist though.","because Anna told her not to wear sunscreen","Thank you even when Anna and dasha regularly posted it was very much the third wheel of the chapo cum sub era","Anna is a mother now, so it's technically a parenting podcast","\"Take the hiking with your baby pill\" - Anna","Anna is so hot","She\u2019s a well fed Ana dasha hybrid","raw gallon of milk a day dasha","Fat girls hate Dasha.","Insufferable girl: \u201chey so there\u2019s this podcast I host with my friend Anna, I really think you\u2019d really like it\u201d",">mid women\n\nSasha is literally a fat man lmao","wow dasha made catholicism cringe again. thank you for your service dasha \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb","Dasha should citizens arrest her","Congrats to Stav and Virgil on their new podcast about childrens' skincare","This truly sounds like something Anna would say on the pod","Yeah thanks Anna very insightful","Stop watching hentai on the plane then","best thing the ladies have done since Anna almost died","God Anna\u2019s so hot when she wears her hair like a woman.","Doing the awkward, back-of-the-neck-massaging \"HAHA yeah I definitely wasn't interested\" boy-girl bit but then having Anna there to flatly go \"We have a lot going on\" is good comedy, cmon","Anna my bb jirl","Anna keeps getting more and more beautiful wtf.","Did Anna get some tasteful lip filler? She looks amazing","Lol I was talking about Anna!  But now that you mention it, Dasha may have a drop of filler. No way has she had a lip lift though, that philtrum is all hers.","Anna looks way better in motion and dasha looks the same as in pictures","anna looks beautiful i love her hair","dammit Anna looks incredible","Anna's energy plummeted when she heard Nick wasn't going to be there. \ud83d\ude36 She is still looking foine though","ITT: Watch the gay men lose their shit over Anna. \"Ohhhh she's so stunninggggggggg. Look at those KNOCKERS! OOOOHHHHH\"","When does Dasha not want somebody?","Anna looks amazing.  I saw her on this episode and killed myself because she's already married and also because she would not be attracted to me even if she was not, for perfectly good reasons which I would wholeheartedly support.","Anna loves describing things as \u201cactually quite mundane\u201d","Anna can't say \"no, witches aren't real you little renard\"","Cringe Anna and based Dasha.\n\nIsn't Anna Armenian? Explains a lot","he was our local schizo and i appreciated his ramblings and stalking of dasha thank you very much","I think there\u2019s a segment on this at the memorial itself","its me, i'm the poor minority. but i would never quit on dasha and anna, not until i find out how they do it.","I think the vibe shift started when Anna had her kid. It was like listening to a Facebook grandma who believs we\u2019ve all been poisoned by fluoride. This weird mix of Slav folksy wisdom and bourgeois dippy hippy shit. Then during covid they both became truly retarded. There\u2019s lots of interesting, sophisticated anti vax arguments but Anna was like, if you vaccinate a child you are worse than Hitler. It was a shame as they\u2019re so brilliant on feminism, identity politics , and anything related to the culture wars.","As a long time listener I\u2019ll say I almost always 100% agree with Anna. So for me, I love that they are both open to change.","Dasha got famous for her sailor socialist rant. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THUFzmmKMPs    \n\n\nOn the pod they used to complain about materialist concerns.  Now she is adamant now she is not a socialist.","If you believe in fat dasha then it\u2019s time to log off","Anna does be looking like a hobbit in that picture","Unrelated to this thread, but I've seen Katie around Seattle a number of times over the years, including back when she was at the stranger and boy is her voice vs how she looks completely disorienting.","dasha\u2019s influence knows no bounds","Adam\u2019s new gf is like if Dasha grew a chest and stopped cheating on him so no I don\u2019t think so","I remember some podcast ep where Dasha was talking about Succession, and how much she would like to be a cast member :)","Dasha absolutely BTFO\u2019d god damn","Congrats Dasha!  Please ignore the jealous detractors, they don't mean shit.","This looks just like anna with a white woman filter","Hiberno-Anna","I like his wife\u2019s podcast, You Must Remember This, he should use his power to make something she writes (if she wants to)","extremely dasha pilled","funniest ep in a while. gym talk was maybe the highlight imo, anna joking about people calling her \"sir\" always makes me laugh","I\u2019m sorry but Dasha does sound insecure about her breast size","lmao at anna's 'understanding' of the salem witch trial. it was exactly the opposite of what she claims. boneheaded! sad!","He\u2019s like that weird Dick smoker who tried to neg Dasha in that call.","What\u2019s amazing about these two assholes is they\u2019ve both never had to dress nice for work\n\nDasha wear a puffer on the red carpet challenge","Wonder kind of hentai Dasha watches? Probably some SICKO stuff","But this is not really Dasha right? Or am I confused?","so true, only dasha posts should be allowed","Dasha had a very funny fight with him on Twitter",">It got me thinking about other guys I see on here that are obsessed with Dasha's \"body count\".\n\n\nnigga it's over 300","Just me or has the puckered lip face made a comeback in the last 2 yrs","if the psychic effect of each of these kind of comments could somehow be unleashed all at once, dasha would probably die one of those fainty victorian deaths",],

I lost so much weight","I meant cut fat while still working out to gain muscle. I\u2019m getting my pre-covid gains back but it\u2019s hard to shake the fat I put on","Hell yeah good luck on your weight loss journey. I lost like 50 pounds and now I can accuse others of being spiritually fat in good conscience. Feels very liberating to bully people who were like me a year ago \ud83d\ude04","count my calories, jog daily, simple as.","An hour isn\u2019t too much, 30 minutes cardio, 30 minutes weights if great for 99% of people.","Lose weight","Yeah I didn\u2019t go into it for health reasons at all but I lost at least 10 pounds right off the bat and I eat much healthier now.","Bulimia doesn\u2019t typically result in the same kind of severe weight loss that anorexia does","This girl I know was saying she wanted to lose weight and couldn't cause of all this different shit tyroid, genetics yadda yadda yadda. I told her last week to drink water and walk an hour a day she lost 7 pounds and is now all fired up for it lmao it's that easy just move your ass!","I mean the overwhelming majority of that was certainly water weight.  You\u2019re not gonna burn seven pounds of fat in a week unless you eat literally nothing and are burning well over 1000 calories a day from exercise.  (It takes about a 3600 calorie deficit to burn a pound of fat and the BMR of a woman is almost certainly going to be well under 2000 calories a day)\n\nWeight loss isn\u2019t as difficult as it\u2019s made out to be in some regards but sustainable weight loss is quite tough.","You can burn about 500kcal an hour doing weightlifting/cardio depending on a bunch of factors. The extra calories you can add back to your diet is what may keep you from going insane on the food portion. \n\nI think people abuse the \u201cyou lose weight by dieting not exercising\u201d as an excuse to not exercise, and instead try to do 1400kcal a day when they could do 30 minutes of good gym time and eat 1700kcal a day to the same effect, and have that extra 300 calorie cushion keep them from breaking. That\u2019s my theory anyways, for why I\u2019ve never actually seen someone lose weight without doing both diet and exercise.","How the fuck does someone lose seven pounds in a week from walking an hour a day? I call BS","You have to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound of fat. A 155 lb person burns about 300 calories walking an hour. Either she wasn\u2019t eating anything at all and was *running* while pumping herself full of diuretics, or you\u2019re lying, because that\u2019s not how thermodynamics work.\n\nThe people on *My 600 Pound Life* lose about a pound a day on a 800-1000 calorie diet and they weigh nearly a ton and usually have lymphedema.",">everything anyone has ever written about weightlifting\n\nThe first result on Google disagrees with you\n\nhttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323922\n\nAlso I mean most of lifting is resting in between sets it just doesn\u2019t make sense that you can burn 500 calories by doing maybe 20 minutes of actual exercise","my fitness tracker on my watch told me an hour and ten of lifting heavy today burned 367 calories. idk how accurate that is but hey",],

What do I actually look like????","She must be fucked up if that fucked her up and not Hard Candy","Can she cast a spell for me too? I want to burn fat quicker, please pray for me.","Not really. My good friend was closer to her. Apparently, they weren't easy to get along with and didn't have many friends.","Willow Smith is hot","a real veronica from heathers character","that literally is not what she looks like?","she looks happy, hot and skinny, you gotta love it!\n\nprops to her.","She looks pretty","Love the dorky smile, first picture where she seems like she isn't high on her farts.","She looks like she got Botox for that magazine cover she was on a couple months back","She\u2019s not really, but she has been made out to be.","she's caricatured and misrepresented constantly. in reality she has very balanced, insightful commentary. if i were to name an \"out there\" feminist i'd say shulamith firestone.","I'd love to see a collage of her bad hair","whos the lady with the landing pad for a forehead","Pretty sure this pic is just a random lady and is from a completely different thing so she wasn\u2019t actually there\n\nShe\u2019s a stand in for what people want to think though so it\u2019s viral\n\nedit: [she literally was not there](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/capitol-meemaw-meme-topeka-kansas)","You know she gives gum jobs out of this world \ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\udc4c","She did?! Wow. There is a shred of humanity in there somewhere, I guess.","She was not at the capitol riot!! She was in a different area at a peaceful gathering and the pic got posted to social media and she got like super harassed and I think she had to move. Sad lol","We didn't deserve Orb Mommy","There's just so much of her we don't deserve","Leave me be woman I need to be alone and completely lose my grip on reality","Her tweet reeks of \"hot girl who has always had her ass kissed by everyone and it warped her perception of reality\"","Wrong on both counts. She\u2019s kinda hot and not funny.","It\u2019s not bad per se but it gets stale. To me it isn\u2019t really fun to converse with someone if they\u2019re just being different for difference\u2019s sake, with no reasoning behind it. I don\u2019t think that last part necessarily describes her though","I can see her now.","What? She\u2019s been a nurse since she was < 13?","She needs a rug","Lol is this what she meant when she was talking about actors having open faces","I am SOBBING I have not laughed this much in an age. God I love her","honestly. i\u2019m happy for her but she really only had\u2026 what two three lines per episode almost? can\u2019t wait to see if she\u2019ll be in season 4.","Our unhinged queen","She emotes like a silent movie actress","also compared to the average nepotism child star actor that makes up 90% of the biz these days she has put in way more work and risk and deserves it way more. she obviously has skill, shes witty, has good cultural intuition and affect, and the way she approaches ppl and enters situations takes tons of balls. ok enuf enuf, happy 4 her goodnight","Aw. Let's all be nice.  She's in the moment.  Congrats to her and lots of emotional stuff to deal with.  She looks great, too. Maybe...she might be high, but I also think she's just totally living it, and good for her!","She wanted to recreate that Wyona moment!","Damn she made a fool of herself","Shes so cute","The way she hugged her way down the line to get to that ideal spot right next to Cox, then hogged the spotlight...

Or worse, you have to be the person to remind people that it's still not okay to whip you dick out at work.","I've heard a lot of stories from friends in IT about how there will be some 1-2 year old language or software and the HR people will junk apps because a candidate doesn't have 5 years of experience with it.","No need to be sorry its a weirdly US specific term used for \u201chigh skill\u201d foreign workers. Think Indian IT worker. Legally? No they get paid the same as everyone else and have full benefits. In actuality theyre exploited by being paid as little as possible and have the worst benefits. Its a weird labor issue for middle upper class workers where foreign labor turns an 80-150k job into a 65k a year job.","no h1 bs get paid\n\nit's the work visa for people who have some type of adv degree beyond a bachelor's and work in compsci or similar","Yep. And you have a decent job im gonna guess? H-1Bs really just flood middle to upper middle class labor pools. Having worked with it extensively I can say that it is %100 a neoliberals wet dream. Diversity for 50% of the cost. Its got a limit of 3 years but if you file for an employment based green card you can file an h-1b indefinitely. With the 5-10 year wait you have an indentured servant for as long as you want.","Good for you for at least engaging with him. I feel real bad for computer science types just entering the workforce. HR controls it and they love control. MBAs want to see it done for cheap and H-1Bs are cheap. Computer stuff is gonna become the new skilled labor of the future.

Killingsworth, a University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business\u00a0senior fellow studying happiness, analyzed data from 33,391 employed adults in the United States.\u00a0\n\nYeah, like I'm gonna trust a study from a Wharton psycho on happiness.","Riiiight ok bud. Those engineering jobs are going to India. If you aren\u2019t going to the office anyways may as well outsource and they are gearing up to do just that.","> it's a shame how so many people just disengage from any meaningful activity after they end their career and just do nothing.\n\nMy mom effectively lost all of her friends when she retired.\n\n Now she putters around the condo, listening to Rumble and swearing at the TV news.","I honestly think old people will work remote jobs in the near future or something","Why is that bleak or dystopian? It sounds communal. I'd spend all my time at work if it was that nice and I could hang out with people relaxing. Beats staying at home wasting away in front of a screen alone.","Godddd I hate working but Christ I can\u2019t get fired","\"werk\" works for anything. The guy doesn't need to worry about being found out.","Are people really trying to take a dogmatic view on working from home? There are obvious benefits and drawbacks to both. How much depends on your personality, existing social life and line of work.","I kind of agree but also don\u2019t want to argue for forcing people back into the office so idk the solution. I\u2019m just lucky I found a position that sends me into an office somewhere every now and then. I genuinely enjoy it for the two weeks or so I\u2019m there. Also gives me a better appreciation for wfh once I\u2019m back.","Not to mention a lot of the people I\u2019ve seen with this take are podcasters or people in online media in general who work from home themselves.","The majority of white collar workers seem to like working from home because they hate commuting by car. I personally like working in person because I walk a mile to the train and then get to have fun riding the train to work. I imagine that all the people that hate working in person just hate traffic and being trapped in their vehicles for an hour","it\u2019s insane that you can be a social worker and work from home to me","If I'm filling my time with working out and reading greek philosophy then I need work to fulfill my social needs otherwise I might kms",">having ZOOM meetings with blurred faces and bad Wifi connections.\n\nGood news, you can just dial in to Zoom now.","work sets you free","I also hate the coffee and multi person bathrooms at work","I may be lonely and isolated but I\u2019d rather work from my 1br apartment where I\u2019m comfortable in my environment than being trapped in a cubicle with people interrupting me every 5 mins.","Going to the office doesn't work for everyone. Some pople have coworkers/bosses who are retards, why the hell would you want to be around them when you can be comfy in your pajamas and do other shit when it's a slow day?\n\nNot enough social interaction? Then get some friends, loser.","Fully remote/hybrid has set off a lot of spicy discourse because there are pretty intense classes of winners and losers. Among the losers are extroverts, which I am not, but I strongly empathize with their loss here because they are born that way. I imagine a bizarro world where office socialization got amped up and how much I would hate that, so I do feel for the extroverts. Perhaps the right compromises are fully onsite weeks and team building offsites, I would be down for that. \n\nThe other losers have been commercial real estate, restaurants and downtown core establishments. I have some sympathy, since they haven't gotten any post-covid reprieve to their woes. But ultimately business is business, and covid is just one factor of the WFH revolt. Others are traffic, shitty transit, ultrahigh rents, open air drug markets, shitty but yet also a lack of policing, and just the soul crushing life of a dense urban environment without regular access to noise-free, pollution-free nature. Central park is nice, but there is no place to dip your toes or escape the smell of weed.\n\nBut the big losers I have absolutely no sympathy for are those people at the office that have casual chats with you, ask you what you are up to, pretend to be brainstorming but are really spying on you, stealing your ideas, gatekeeping your work and stirring shit cuz that's their role in the company. Those people have been gutted by WFH cuz you can't casually slip into someone's zoom, and they are always the one screaming the loudest to force everyone back into the office. Fuck them.","Sure it depends a lot on the company and the job, but I have a family member who worked a job where just saying \u201cno\u201d wasn\u2019t an option and it completely eroded her sense of serenity when being at home. Going back to the office was a life-saver.\n\nIt just seems like for most people it comes down to 1) No commute and 2) they actually work less. But if you could have a reasonable commute (walkable) and work reasonable hours then, at least in my situation which I\u2019m fortunate enough to have, working at work is way preferable to being at home on the computer. I get real depressed real quick.\n\nSo much is to say I disagree with calling it an op. Too many downsides to WFH depending on the variables.","If you\u2019re a tech worker and your job already entails staring at a computer screen all day then of course you\u2019ll do it from home if given the choice - what difference does it make!\n\nBut if you work a job that has you looking at and talking to people, walking, doing things which aren\u2019t looking at a screen, then you might prefer to keep that situation rather than be forced to suddenly stare at your computer all day which is (again, for some people) hellishly depressing.","this was 100% my last job, felt like I was going crazy working long hour with no contact.\nThen any contact was messaging over slack, IMing should be for bullshitting not running a company.\nBoth my professional and love life are in shambles due to my inability to be a good texter.","I\u2019d say there\u2019s advantages to both, but what the battle lines here really are, I think, is that a lot of the work-from-home proponents care less about doing anything about the atomized antisocial culture that\u2019s been nurtured by Twitter and exacerbated by the pandemic. The others think humanity needs to do something to rediscover social bonds. The introverts won\u2019t say it, but the past three years have been a hermit\u2019s paradise.","I hate the 2-3 hours of commuting. I hate paying all my money to live in a garbage hive city where the offices are. I hate the shitty landlords. I hate the shitty neighbourhoods. I hate the open toilets. I hate the shitty furniture. I hate that someone is always sick. I hate the noise. I hate the smell. I hate the heat. I hate the terrible, limited and overpriced lunch options. I hate hearing people scream at each other on calls. I hate that I'm just there to sit on calls for most of the day with people in other offices in other countries. I hate the retard with tonsil stones who keeps coming over to ask a \"quick question\".\n\nI've been working from home for a year and a half. I love going swimming in my lunch break. I love living in nice apartments and paying much less. I love living in the countryside. I love the food. I love my local cafes and restaurants. I love working outside in the sun. I love getting the time back from not commuting. I love being able to improve my work environment. I love my great chair. I love being able to change the temperature. I love being able to wear whatever. I love being able to have nice food. I love being able to socialise with who I like. I love the extra time and energy to do things in the evening. I love being able to move apartments/cities/countries without it impacting my work situation.\n\nWorking from home is the single biggest luxury available to the middle classes bar none. I could double my salary going back to working in an office, but I consider that a bad deal.","That\u2019s the modern day job market as a whole, bud","i mean i enjoy WFH and generally do it most of the time, but some of my best friends on earth i met at my new grad job because we bonded over, well, being new to the city, not liking our job or the people in it, and having similar interests outside of work. we haven\u2019t worked together in years or even lived in the same city but we\u2019re going to jamaica together next month. i don\u2019t think \u201cbeing friendly with your coworkers\u201d is a huge draw. but \u201cmeeting coworkers you can be actual friends with\u201d is often too unfairly dismissed imo","I HATE REMOTE WORK!\n\nI HATE REMOTE WORK!\n\nI WANT TO COMMUTE FOR THREE HOURS A DAY TO PLACATE SOME MIDDLE MANAGEMENT BUSYBODY INSTEAD OF ROLLING OUT OF BED AND FINISHING ALL MY WORK BEFORE NOON!","Really disconcerting how much people rely on work for social fulfillment.","Extended WFH is robbing younger workers of social capital they need to advance in a way they\u2019ll only realize in a few years. It makes you much more easily disposable in a hard times, no one even needs to clean out an office","if you have friends outside of work then wfh is great, but I could imagine someone moving to a new city or something and struggling with it","See that wasn't my experience at all. Before COVID, I had dudes w 40 years experience setting time aside specifically to show me how to do something, which is basically essential for when guys like that retire. \n\nAfter COVID, it was like sending a senior a message over Teams was inconveniencing them, and specific teaching opportunities became less frequent/lower quality. \n\nYeah I obviously agree that wages aren't everything, but it's a lot to many people. Also, I was using wages as a proxy for involvement in/quality of work, which I don't think young people realize the importance of early on. \n\nYou'll probably have a family and all, but raising them is only a portion of your life.  Also, no matter what, you'll have to spend some chunk of your day working anyways. Being good enough at something to have an actual role in the process is an important step of taking the torch and moving society forward. A person will be depressed at work and making less money until they retire if you truly aren't interested in building skills. Being able to say \"I did **that**.\" is important. \n\nI just think there are greater long-term macroeconomic implications missing from work from home discourse.","You know \u201ccontrarian\u201d doesn\u2019t just mean an opinion you disagree with?\n\nI despise commuting to work and am the first to complain about bloat and unnecessary physical presence for a lot of jobs, but acting like there\u2019s no psychological downside to WFH is insane.\n\nAt least in the US, adults probably spend at least 50% of their waking lives at work (for better or worse) so completely isolating your main source of social interaction post-college is surely gonna lead to some consequences.","> It makes you much more easily disposable in a hard times, no one even needs to clean out an office\n\nThat's never going to be the straw that breaks the camels back, in situations like that it'll really only come down to a few things- whether you're arbitrarily liked by whoever is in charge of making that decision or if you are actually indispensable to the company in some way.","I'm just saying that \"no shortage of in-person opportunities\" is a simplistic and potentially deceiving portrait.","The solution to most adult's broken social lives isn't forcing them to mingle at work lol, it's allowing them to have more freetime outside work. Working from home allows me to not have to commute and have way more time for the people who I actually want to spend time with instead of listening to some dude tell me a story about some show I don't care about. I'm not saying it's 100% \"good\" or anything, there are definite drawbacks, like the sort of blending of work hours/off time hours, but that was going on well before working from home.","Sure but it\u2019s easy to be arbitrarily liked when you establish a relationship face to face. You\u2019re really more of a cog if you\u2019re just a face your boss sees on a Zoom screen a few times a week. It also usually isn\u2019t that arbitrary when someone is disliked in an office, it\u2019s always been pretty obvious in my experience","I like it because I'm literally getting paid to do nothing. I do about 20 minutes of actual work each day, and then spend the rest of the time watching TV and movies. I rewatched the entirety of The Sopranos on the clock last year, it was great. It's also lonely as fuck though. I do kind of miss slacking off work by socialising like I used to.","I think you've misinterpreted everything I said. \n\nI was talking about early career technical positions and how WFH almost certainly negatively impacts the rate in which they learn technical skills. Once you have the skills, no shit, try to get out of the office - you've got what you need to succeed. \n\nAll that bargaining you're talking ab is fine after that, but I would not advice a young person trying to become successful to skip out on any opportunities to learn how to actually do something, because many people have no real marketable skills, which has severe financial and personal fulfillment consequences. \n\nNot everything has to be antiwork level analysis.",">Yes, a completely different functioning workforce would be ideal, hence the \u201cfor better or for worse\u201d but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re talking about.\n\nI know it's not, that's why I brought it up, because it's important context for the entire conversation. There are so many bigger issues with US work culture and social life. \n\n>You also create this weird class divide between those \u201cemployed from home\u201d vs \u201cemployed in person.\u201d\n\nDoesn't this just exist regardless though? If we're going to be doing leftist critique, isn't it better that this is more obvious?","> force it on coworkers\n\nlmao","My software agency has been fully remote for 10+ years.  Our team is rock solid, I love my coworkers even though I have never met them in person, and we get shit done on time.","? just make friends with your coworkers","My fully remote company does things like games night and casual shoot-the-shit meetings on Friday to help with the bonding we might otherwise get from being in an office.  It works, I genuinely care about my coworkers lives even though I have never met them.","I do, and did before I worked from home.\n\nBut schools are less hierarchical and lacking in HR departments the way office workplaces are.","those barriers were gone long ago. work 9-5, drive home. log on at 8 to keep working. that's been the norm for a while in certain careers","truck driver for the doing your mom company actually. if you work a real job and don't have any friendships with coworkers then you're either unlucky or just unpleasant to be around. sorry","I had 2 years in nyc when we weren\u2019t going to the office. Finally been back since the spring. It totally screwed up all the entry level peoples development substantially, really across my whole industry. WFH is great for a lot of job, but for other it\u2019s like chocolate cake. It tastes great but if you eat it every day you become fat and it\u2019s bad for you.","I legitimately feel like Milton from Office Space sometimes. I don't have a fake email job but I could still just stop working for like 6 months and make up the things I'm doing and get by. My boss has changed a few times and doesn't know enough to call it out.\n\nI don't do that, I actually enjoy the work I do, but it's getting hard to keep that as a motivator.","I have genuinely never had a job where I did not hate everyone involved. Convinced anyone who enjoys hanging out with their coworkers is borderline psychopathic.","I remember going on a tirade against advertising and my coworker was like 'but what about all those jobs?'\n\nAnd I said \"we could just pay them to sit and do nothing and the world would be a better place\". \n\nAnd of course, he said that wouldn't be right, because they wouldn't do any productive work.\n\nMhmm","I never took an ounce of achievement from my trade job. I literally built homes which is tangible but it was just a job. Now I\u2019m in school to become an office person who doesn\u2019t produce anything and save my back in the process. Also won\u2019t have to touch a bunch of industrial solvents used in plumbing construction everyday.\nI gave up on trying to derive meaning from work it\u2019s just work then I go home, I think most adults should come to that conclusion before 30. Hopefully much sooner.","There\u2019s a market for everything.","I have worked 16 hour shifts working for myself (without eating) that felt like the slowest 4 hour days working for someone else.","Too many layoffs at once in small areas. If she\u2019s in the Bay maybe not. They\u2019re temporarily saturated with skilled SWEs looking for jobs and most of them don\u2019t need sponsors.","smart at mba shit / getting promoted, and dumb about literally anything else. every job is hyper-specialized, there is no incentive to be a generalist anywhere - why would this be any different?","I get off work at that time, id hate it hahaha",">I\u2019m sorry for you if you want to work yourself to death \n\nLmao. Spoken like someone who\u2019s never worked a single day of manual labor in their life. I have a similar kushy, bullshit email job, and I don\u2019t even take the full 30 minutes sometimes. You can survive without an hour long lunch. It\u2019s great that it\u2019s an option for you, but you won\u2019t fucking die without it.","They should be using the ELO system instead, haven't they watched The Social Network?","Technical jobs require multiple monitors.  \n\nYou can spot the people whose job involves interpersonal interaction, because they move around the office more like a cat -- taking calls and writing emails as they migrate around the liminal space.","I remember having this conversation when offices started to tentatively reopen after the pandemic and in-person attendance wasn't yet mandatory. My industry doesn't have fancy offices, but only people in their early 20's were going in- it's coz they were living in crappy shared apartments with three housemates, stuck in their bedrooms to work and sleep. So going into the office was actually a relief for them.

If you have a dull grey boring office where people fight over milk for their instant coffee, they're going to start wanting a workalike balance, god forbid.\n\nHowever, I may be a bit of a masochist, but I do appreciate having done the long hours/suffering for a quinoa bowl at 11pm when I was a bit younger. It's like having worked a crummy retail job in high school and call center job in college- you learn skills and how good you have it at each stage up the ladder of getting your life together, and you grow a bit tougher from the experience.  \nThe paychecks typically get comfortable and the job gets easier once you've earned your stripes, gained respect, and pass the grunt work to the next generation for them to earn their stripes. I don't need any fancy perks.

Also curious as to how your major worked out for you, job-wise","agree--in my old org there was dramatic upper management change and people went to aws recruiting like rats off a ship because it was an easy placeholder job to get internally while you plotted your next move. you do have to meet hiring quotas, but from what I heard, the quotas weren't too tough.","I was a security guard for an apartment building w just 8 floors so no a lot going on and it\u2019s a lot of where my internet addiction came from","Pretty sure the distinction was always built around the lines of 'produces something with tangible social/economic value' vs those who don't. Coders do produce product, PMC people manage product. Or, perhaps manage people who manage product.","Why is it weird to claim it's impossible to make friends with the people you spend 8 hours a day, 5 days a week with? Do you really have to ask?","I became and still am good friends with some coworkers because we would make fun of the losers at our shitty part time job when we were younger. None of us work there anymore but when we get together you can mention a name or story and we will all remember and laugh about it.","so far almost all of my friends have come from jobs I\u2019ve worked at and I love all them to death","Always better to be buds with the guy directly above you than be good at your job. I work for a small business the boss, me and two others. The other two are much more experienced than me but I've told me, in no uncertain terms I'd be the last guy he cuts if things get bad because he can't stand being around the other two.","It's pretty real though even outside of reddit. I took a remote job over the pandemic and recently flew into the HQ for an all-hands meeting -- only half of the people on my team attended (despite them all living near the HQ they opted to stay home and attend remotely instead). The only teammate that wanted to go out for happy hour after the meetings that I got to know a little bit ended up laid off a week later. I thought the sterileness of the job was due to only communicating through slack but it turns out there's just a lot of people that don't really have any intention of being friendly with coworkers. It's really bizarre to me that you'd want to spend a significant portion of your week in that kind of mental state. \n\nThe pendulum has definitely swung the other way from the forced social events that seemed to come with every job early in my career. I almost miss the potlucks (almost).","Yeah, honestly irl people are definitely manipulated into believing their coworkers are their friends way more than they actually are, which has led to this. A lot of us have been burned many times by trusting coworkers way too much, and it\u2019s terrifying how many people will actually just use it against you. \n\nLike I don\u2019t even mean trusting them a super unreasonable amount, jumping into personal stuff way too soon, expecting them to back you when you admit you\u2019ve been stealing from the company, whatever. But just\u2026 a lot of us just kinda naturally started treating coworkers the way we did our friends in school/college, but it\u2019s fundamentally different because your coworkers are in direct competition with you and it gets slimy. Yeah you\u2019ll make friends at work but it\u2019s much more difficult and rare. People have far more incentive to act fake around you, and for longer. And when they decide to use gossip and such against you, the consequences are way worse than they are in school. If you have a messy breakup or do something dumb on the weekends while drunk when you\u2019re a college student, it ultimately doesn\u2019t really matter and is only going to affect you socially- it doesn\u2019t influence your grades or anything. As an adult? That can easily cost you your job, if indirectly.\n\nThis is of course more or less true depending on the industry. But lots of office jobs are VERY much like this","Why don't you become best friends with a co-worker?","I dont get what jobs you people work I don\u2019t think the ones above you are friendly but you and your colleagues are all being shat on by the same asshole. There\u2019s solidarity in that","I work at a fast food place with one other person. I don\u2019t even know how I would get through all the days of work without being able to gossip about customers with her.","The current people I like and will stay in touch. The type As at some of the other jobs were competition and backstabbed. I just feel out the environment. I also am more open with people after I stop working with them.","Yeah, I ended up going down a rabbit hole and seeing that per some cursory searches. Definitely a difference in salary there vs my middle of nowhere rural Midwest ass, and I make pretty decent money for working remote and where I live.","People who don\u2019t take days off are psychos","The job thing isn't your fault, the economy is not great right now - soon to get much much worse - and there's something fucky wrong with the recruiting industry\n\nIdk about all that other stuff tho","Rough. Any of your coworkers treat you differently?",],

text: ["I hear this stuff constantly. When there's blood in the streets it's going to surprise a lot of people. \nComfortable people. Every one else will only pause when their axe handle is too slippery to keep a good grip","Lol now do Central Valley. Not commuting 1-3 hours a day one way is a luxury.","Play it during your commute so you can feel your time being wasted even faster",">Rich people don\u2019t take the bus. \n\nthey do if the public transportation system is good, at least sometimes.","Lol the only reason suburbs exist is to be next to cites. It's how cites encroach on land and take over making an enormous urban sprawl. Suburban areas don't exist in a vacuum they need cites to survive. How would building more cites help the US?","didnt say they shouldnt have trains i said they shouldnt have spent 2 trillion dollars on trains to no where that people dont use lol","It's more so that it's something you create when you have a shit ton of undeveloped land alongside what you said.\n\nThe only parts of the country today that aren't totally developed with roads and railroads are certain remote parts of Montana/Wyoming and Alaska.\n\nMaybe with climate change it would someday be worth it building out an entire road network for the Alaskan Bush but we are pretty far away from that point.","40% of the budget and they couldn't even run in and stop an 18-year-old with a gun. \n\nImagine what they could've done with that 40% of the budget. They could just give it to me to spend on vacations in Aruba and plasma TVs and there wouldn't be any more dead kids then there already are.","If you\u2019ve got a car to drive, you\u2019ve got a car to sleep in. \n\nI stand by this rule so I have made my ride into as comfortable and safe a potential snoozing spot as possible.","The economic benefits of having a stadium are usually wildly overstated by the teams demanding them so they can have at least a semblance of a logical reason for dumping billions of public dollars towards a wildly overpriced shiny object. Most economists agree that you\u2019d be better off dumping that money over the city in a blimp if you wanted to materially improve the finances of your citizens. Not to mention that these teams are owned by the richest people in the world and should be forced to build them themselves if the community has no stake in the franchise (i.e. not Green Bay, most of the Bundesliga, etc). Additionally, in SoCal, new stadiums wildly surpass the capabilities of the existing transportation infrastructure and create hellish parking lots that take up ridiculous amounts of space (such as the monstrosity of spaces from The Forum+SoFi Stadium). I love sports more than anything in the world, but publicly funded stadiums are usually enormous scams and cities should prioritize spending that money on additional housing and public services, leaving the owners/leagues to figure out stadium financing.","I have a special set of clothes and way to brush my hair when I ride greyhound so that I can instill either fear or trust into my fellow passengers. If you have beggars on your commute experiment with your appearance until they don\u2019t ask you for change, at that point you have discovered how to walk among the bums","basically. if you buy name brand toothpaste and don't take the bus to work you're middle class in most of america","Not designated, but separate. Riding a bike like 5 feet away from car traffic is big dumb.","We need to go back to 1700s transposition technology. Horses and trains. If you want to vacation in Italy, you earn that shit with a boat ride across the Atlantic.","I would go as big as your frame can accommodate probably semi slick if it's mostly for urban transport.","People used to get run over by trams and horses all the time too, with the difference being that people in the early 20th century acknowledged that was a risk.","Meh Most people I know who got hurt biking weren't hurt because of infrastructure.  It was dogs,  leaves, obstacles or other bikers.\n\nGranted it probably depends a bit on the speed you are going.  But the Idea that they are safe is just fantasy.  Especially considering that helmets suck enough to cut ridership down by more than half.","Well France has six for instance and Italy has seven, scale that up to the US' population and you'd have the biggest thirty or forty cities with metro lines. Not that it would ever be possible to do anything like that obviously. I dunno where you're from (I'm British born and raised now a dual American citizen living in the States) but it's obviously not the case that you can't have a life in European cities without a car. It *is* true in a lot of American cities.","The problem is most of those things used to exist and as cars became more and more popular they couldn't be sustained.","If you live a pleasant walk from work, rain or shine, or a pleasant bike ride either, then this is fine.  But we don't all live in big glasses, ironic beard, full sleeve tat Brooklyn.  Some of have someplace to be and it ain't close.","I have a friend who got a bad concussion due to his bike slipping on wet leaves (he\u2019s a daily bike commuter, not inexperienced), my husband who\u2019s also a daily bike commuter hydroplaned in a parking lot and got pretty badly hurt (not fun when your spouse is late home and you get a call saying he\u2019s hurt and can\u2019t get up).\n\nThat\u2019s not to mention all the almost accidents or small accidents of a car turning into a bike lane or pedestrian stepping into it or other cyclist stopping randomly. And that\u2019s the people I know, doesn\u2019t include the times I\u2019ve witnessed someone needing an ambulance while on their bike commute (twice).","If you roll coal, you have to pay the toll","I wish there was something in the constitution that protects the internal combustion engine.  It's more american than firearms, so I don't know what the big deal is.","Imagine needing your city to be built a certain way to not be fat. I bet if European cities were made now, they would all be fat.","i love public transport but i also like cars, they look cool and make cool sounds and driving fast is cool and fun\n\nplease don't take that away from me by calling me fat because then i have to start hating cars because i'm not fat","It's not that hard for cities at least, only for suburbs.","I wish that was true but I really don't think it is.  Mainly because cities used to have really good public transportation all across America, but as people used those systems less and less they decayed and eventually largely went away.  You'd have to completely change US culture in a way that seems incredibly difficult to accomplish.","Yeah I agree completely.  I live in a place where it should be pretty easy to take the train to two different metro areas and that is definitely what lots of people would prefer to do, but it's so expensive and unreliable and slow that almost no one actually does.","Cars are for undeveloped travel where roads aren\u2019t pristine.\n\nFor any developed city, anything other than cars is preferable.","cars are awesome. it's like your own home away from home. The country was built on single person transportation, and it's a far better way of getting around. driving at night with music on or even no music alone is such a relaxing feeling.","I'm looking at moving to a similar situation. I was paying a luxury of a few hundred to live in a \"not the walkable city center but still not far\" area, but my rent just went up $600 a month this year and I only signed a (short) lease because travel plans meant I wouldn't have been able to make the move easily.\n\nMy preference has always been to live somewhere where I have places, ideally a grocery store or similar place as well as a nice dive bar, the are close, by which I mean <1 hour walk. Commuting without a car has never really been an option for me, the only people who do that are yuppy trash living in studio apartments with their $200k job. And they don't actually live a car free life because they all get almost all of their meals and groceries delivered.\n\nBut now, Ubering to places in the city has gotten expensive and costs a minimum of $12 regardless of how far (a 2 minute drive and a 15 minute drive are about the same price), so I might just have to take the \"live in a shitty suburban apartment for a year or so until I move to a city that's not been completely destroyed\" pill this spring.","Why? Do you think in Europe we dont have cars?","Cars suck. Go somewhere where you don't need one and save money for booze, tobacco, and a down payment on a country home","Given the majority on this sub are Americans, I would wager that most people (perhaps not folks in NYC or similar) have cars. Meanwhile the Europeans are all riding around on buses and trams and not defining their whole fuckin identity by owning a bike.","I mean if you're American your commute is probably an hour sitting in a car in stead of walking 20 minutes and on public transit reading for 20 minutes. I don't blame people for not wanting to do that as commuting in a car for a long time is linked to vastly worse health outcomes","And you don\u2019t get paid for those 15 hours you spend commuting each week.","Not American but traffic is awful where I live. I don\u2019t mind going to the office, but the commute is what drives me crazy. I wouldn\u2019t mind going to the office if it meant a 20 minute train ride","I think you might need to get out more, or at least a visit to a non obese country.","Just got home after being on the subway with a man in the car so repellently smelly that I had to wash all of my clothes and shower when I got home after being 6 feet away from him for a while.\n\nWith that kind of shit happening on a daily basis I'm at the point where I'd love to live in a Singapore like society.","I suggest you take a boat in the Mediterranean and see how they look like after 60. They all have metabolic disease from eating too much pasta.","Ok but she spent 20 minutes just to fume about fare jumpers so who's a bigger drain on society?","riding the metro for free is one my daily pleasures, it feels like teleporting","meanwhile fares increase and the MTA falls even further into disrepair","The rest of us pay because it\u2019s part of being a good citizen in the city and supporting public goods","Maybe my taxes should pay for it instead of another fucking aircraft carrier","good on ya. should be free though. also literally who cares. if you don\u2019t wanna pay don\u2019t. if you\u2019re fine financially then pay. why care","It\u2019s not free though. It\u2019s not free in Paris and it\u2019s not free in London either.\n\nPeak RSP to complain about the lack of public transit in American cities then not understand that fares are necessary to keep these things running","Ralph Nader and his consequences have been a disaster for the automobile race","The DC metro is still pretty good tbh","Not even close lol. You think those massive overpasses are paid by the tiny gas taxes?","I dnno, manage the station. Probably a bullshit job tbh but they have no power to detain or fine. That\u2019s the cops or the transit cops job.","i\u2019m not from nyc but i don\u2019t get it tbh. isn\u2019t the job of the attendant to stop that kind of thing or no? is there security? i\u2019ve used the subway like 3 times so i genuinely don\u2019t remember","Individualization of everything.  Ideally it should be free for everyone who can\u2019t afford it. Mta is fucked because of austerity, not this shit.","there are transit systems that run purely off taxes just fine","Several college towns in the US have fully tax funded bus systems that have good ridership and well maintained vehicles\n\nI rode one for many years when I lived in Chapel Hill and worked at UNC. Never paid a single fare, and almost never drove to work.","The reality is that the subway in nyc is bad because a fraction of these jumpers use it as their bathroom / cannabis smoke shack / masterbatorium / music performance / disturbed freak out panic zone. \n\nBut the system is hopelessly corrupt and a people living at the bottom of a brutal city seem placated by getting away with this relatively minor thing so it feels cruel to take it from them","Or you know places with good public transport *invest* heavily in it and often subsidize prices for end consumers","Amused at the Reddit-ass takes in this subreddit blaming the 20 percent max of fare evaders for the failures of North American public transit. R all type beat","I pretty consistently have bad interactions with uber drivers tho. Just last week my driver cancelled my ride and then insisted on driving me the rest of the way \u201coff meter\u201d because \u201cim too pretty to pay.\u201d","If you live in a city center then your commute to and from the date won\u2019t be long and it\u2019s not a big deal to just go to a restaurant for lunch and dinner and have some dude pay for it.","1) Erect permanent barriers to prevent this. One time cost eventually pays for itself.\n\n2) Levy a $10,000 fine. Have plainclothes cops enforce it randomly and unpredictably.\n\n3) Put cameras in stations and offer $50 rewards for citizens' arrests of jumpers.\n\nAll have problems, but solutions are out there.","Lol controversial but I get her- public amenities working should mean everyone pays. But just make it so that it\u2019s impossible to jump the fair rather than expect people to interfere when they see it. That is a potentially dangerous situation to be in","I'm going to New York for a week (from Scotland) and will definitely be going to the Met. Am I likely to be pushed onto a subway rail by a mentally ill person? That's my number 1 worry.","I don\u2019t really get where I\u2019m endorsing any kind of shitty behaviour by suggesting that what the collective puts into the system should be used to benefit the collective rather than to enrich, empower, and entrench the military-industrial complex and security state, which does very little in a tangible sense to contribute to the collective. Things like public transit should absolutely be free: you already fucking pay for it - they are not free because your government (mileage may vary based on where you are but for this example let\u2019s assume America) has decided to take your collective input and spend it, largely, on things that do not have a positive material impact on your life and the lives of the collective, so yes, I\u2019m afraid system is indeed bad. I really don\u2019t understand what your argument here is or why exactly you\u2019re digging your heels in here but have fun I guess.","i didnt care this much when i worked for the subway","it's annoying when you go on a date with someone you didn't connect with though and then you wasted all that time that you could have spent playing with model trains","Buy a project car.",],

The remake simply isn't as good because it inadequately fails to capture the psychology and spirit of the characters in the original.

The issue isn't even say marvel movies, it's that people treat them as if they're fantastic works of art up there with actual quality storytelling.\n\nWhat makes those movies have mass appeal is that action movies look fantastic in big screen theatres, but truthfully pretty shit at home.","In three hundred years time superhero movies will be looked back on as the most wildly deranged cultural pathology of our time","I don't like Marvel movies, I just think these things move in cycles.

Go watch Titane or Pearl and stop  bitching about capeshit, you effete retards.","The biggest issue, in my opinion, is the monopoly created by Disney and similar media companies. If Marvel was its own company making films every now and then, people would definitely care less. This would never happen though, as these companies obviously want to make as much money as possible (whether that's good or bad, you tell me). \n\nComics are always going to be nerdy, but I'm not going to lie to myself and say I've always hated them. Hell, I still find the visuals of old comic books stellar. The main issue is that they're unavoidable.  \n\nPeople just don't like when something is shoved in their faces too much, but the Mouse is not concerned about that. I don't really blame them either, as they're obviously more concerned about making money rather than what a niche minority of fans and critics think.","Universal's monster movies make for a better comparison. Over reliance on special fx, crossovers, and generally getting worse over time. The monster movie craze ended with a whimper with Ed Wood being the only one making them. I can see the same thing happening to Marvel. A few flops and the whole thing goes bust. I guess you could compare them to the big Hollywood musicals too considering how expensive they are. We need at least 2 big marvel flops to be free from this shit.","there's probably been plenty of those films made it's just they're not hits like they were back then because they're not a new thing anymore. The reason half those films don't get made isn't people are dumb now or some stupid crap like that but because all those tropes and plots were constantly done by studios after to try and cash in on the success of those films and it kill those movies.","Keep seeing this \"catering to the Chinese\" narrative, yet the Chinese domestic culture is at such a nationalistic/anti-American point and the gov't censor's grip on pop culture is so tight that few Hollywood blockbusters get imported at all. Of this year's top 10 grossing Hollywood movies they didn't get Top Gun, Elvis, Nope, or any Marvel(been stonewalled for a while now for unknown reason)/superhero movies. EEAAO (or Shang-Chi of last year btw) being a movie with prominent Chinese-American rEprEsentAtiOn... of course didn't get released in China, no surprise there to anyone familiar with the Chinese censorship. \n\nAnd the supposed affinity that \"Chinese sensibility\" has towards this superhero stuff lol. Like stereotypically, does it make sense? The Chinese love special ultra-individualistic Americans saving the day? China didn't have a comic book culture at all, and didn't have a working nation-wide modern film distribution system until like, last decade. Just as the nascent Chinese middle class started the habit of going to the movies, Hollywood started pushing Avatar and Marvel flicks. They responded, they would've responded to any other kinds of broad appeal crowdpleasers, they would've gobbled up Forest Gump clones. Now that Chinese movie market is more and more exclusionary to foreign imports, what kind of domestic movies make the most money? War movies and comedies. \n\nAt some point Hollywood gotta realize that they misused their cultural molding powers for a gold rush, and reduced the default moviegoing experience only to gawking at childish spectacles, gradually killing the general interest in moviegoing, further painting themselves into a corner where only childish spectacles make money. They did this to themselves.","Not denying the existence of studio self-censorship (though some of the studios probably realized the futility in trying to engage with the ever more strict Chinese censors and [stopped caring in recent years](https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-pretty-confident-films-succeed-without-china)). I'm saying specifically the superhero movie craze isn't meaningfully a result of \"catering to the Chinese\", especially since the Marvel machine has been churning without the Chinese market (with the understanding that there's basically a ban imposed on Marvel movies there) for several years now.","You\u2019re absolutely right that if cape shit didn\u2019t exist then a different genre would fill the void.\n\nLook back at the mid-20th century; westerns were the capeshit of those days.","Yeah it\u2019s just straightforward hero\u2019s journey with nice special fx","That's a TV schedule, not close to one...","Yeah this guy doesn\u2019t know that the Francophone world is literally a titan of animation. When was the last time a Disney movie didn\u2019t look like cheap CGI plastic sludge?",">You can\u2019t name a single piece of French animation that is as well done as Disney\n\nSure but that's a very high bar to cross, only perhaps a few select anime productions reach it.","I think I really have seen too much Goddard. He is spoken of as being a pillar of the movement so I assumed many shared similarities. I have seen many that were down to earth as well. Some of his stuff I find good simply for how little he wants to give you the pleasure of it being like other movies you have seen.","I always get confused between that and *Johnny Mnemonic*, is it worth a watch? Seem to remember it got slated when it came out","it felt like a Z movie satire of the \"eat the rich\" movie trend, except it wasn't over the top enough for that and they didn't cast nic cage","Those two actors can not be compared. Hanks is an overrated hack, Bale is brilliant in all his roles.","idk how else to say this but the elvis movie fucking ruled, and tom hanks in the obvious fat suit talking in a ridiculous outfit made it even better","Marvel writers seething","To be fair, part the problem with such a plan going forward is that normie taste has legitimately declined over the past decade or so, IMO. Back in 2010, _The Social Network_ earned over $200 million at the box office. Could such a movie, no matter how good, ever hope to earn that much money today?\n\nIt\u2019s telling that David Fincher seems to have thrown in the towel and retreated to streaming.","definitely. i actually thought 1917 was better than dunkirk but now I think this is better than 1917. honestly all war movies SHOULD do this but most fail somehow: this is the first war movie to truly leave me with this awful sickening feeling in my stomach of \u2018war is really truly awful and it needs to never happen, we are sick animals\u2019","All films are an intellectual exercise especially the fun ones. Cope harder.","Everything Everywhere\u2026 is one of the most overrated films of recent years.

So many of them pretend to show the \u2018horrors\u2019 of war by going \u2018look, peoples heads are being shot off!\u2019 but still make the main characters look like honourable brave brothers who are fighting the enemy and being cool action heroes. This movie laughs at that notion: they\u2019re all naive scrawny kids who had no skills or purpose other than being ignorant cattle fodder, tricked into murdering each other (and their own sanity) for the egos of men they will never meet. and how I\u2019m wording that doesn\u2019t even match how well it\u2019s portrayed on screen - great movie\n\njfc humans suck","I had a lot of fun watching it and it's not capeshit, a remake, a sequel or an adaptation of something else. That's all I ask from a movie nowadays.","Agreed. I thought it was fun. Not the best film of the year, but I don't get the hate in this subreddit. Probably too \"political\" for the right wingers here.","I love Michele Yeoh from her time in Hong Kong films, and I haven't seen EEAO, but I don't get her response to its success, as if her many years in HUGE Chinese blockbusters didn't happen and she's just a scrappin' up and coming actress in racist USA. It's so weird. I get it, it's definitely harder getting good parts as an Asian person in the USA. . . But she doesn't live here?  And she isn't American (as far as I could find from a quick search); she's very rich and, in fact, she's been married to two multi-millionaire schmucks (billionaires?) over the years and is, again, massively popular as an actress throughout Asia (and with nerds in the USA). But, sure, Michele:  \"This is also for all the shoulders that I stand on, all who came before me, who look like me, and all who are going on this journey with me forward...\"","Films can simply be fun but this was not one of them.","I enjoyed Nope, but I have no idea why anyone would think it should receive awards nominations","C\u2019mon, some of these movies are pretty good.","Which is ironically the point of the movie.","It so badly wants to be an important movie, wants it so much that instead of actually being good it spends the whole movie wildly insisting to you that it has depth. In reality it is a family drama with all the time where they would flesh out the characters replaced with gags and visual spectacle that would be impressive ten years ago. Movie is the definition of wide as the ocean deep as a puddle. The guys that wrote it almost certainly hate their mother.","I\u2019ve never seen it but I always see such negative comments abt the movie on here. Why is it so bad?

That scene made me cry and was significantly more moving than anything else.\n\nI felt a lot of the earlier parts of the film were so heavy in the \"look how brutal war is\" that it became almost comical - but the quietness of finding this poor French mans family photo and business card just broke me.","it's a marvel movie without the logo. it's about nothing, and whatever it tries to say is unearned. combine that with paint-by-numbers asian immigrant \"story\", and you get this slop\n\nIt's championed by people who around 2021 FINALLy realized openly liking superhero shit is embarrassing, and are very sad about it. If you have a retard friend who ever told you something akin to \"Marvel fell off after xyz\", they probably also believe Everything Everywhere changed their life","Jesus I get it. everything is a nice summary of the mediocre, heavy-handed movies that fair well with critics right now. Very cool of the very cool people here to recognize that.\n\nBlanchett is still a pretty heavy betting odds favorite despite a really bland script with nothing that even approaches a conclusion.","Really disagree, war le bad is overrated as a theme, not original in its delivery, the WW1 tropes it uses are stale AF.

Of course it's going to fluctuate more toward high-end, most people aren't watching Lifetime productions and public access movies. Most movies that get buzz have some level of competence, so a focus on the 6-9 range seems reasonable, though the average of 5 needs more focus. I think your criticism of scale is glib and not valid.","I had the opposite take on it. The movie was the exact opposite of the standard it was trying to advocate for. It was a pretentious, pseudo-intellectual movie shitting on pretentious pseudo-intellectual movies.","The movies nominated are pretty weak for the most part. The only movies this year that I saw that I really liked and remembered were All Quiet On The Western Front, Barbarian, The Northman, and, surprisingly Emily the Criminal.

Is Maverick a good genre film? Yes, but so is fucking Spider-Man 2 and nobody here would soyface about how Raimi saved cinema with that film. The adoration for Avatar 2 is even worse because at least Maverick is a fine genre film, Avatar needed at least an entire hour lobbed off of it and had one of the most hilariously bad scripts I\u2019ve seen in recent years.","Yeah people can contrarian themselves about it all they want but Avatar 2 is fucking horrible. Maverick is at least fun but being a good genre film should not equal best movie of the year in most cases.","A lot of the praise I\u2019ve seen of Yeoh recently seems to either ignore the fact that she\u2019s been massively popular and successful for decades, or just assume that international cinema doesn\u2019t matter and it\u2019s all about Marvel & minions","A lot of the criticism seems to be salt that it\u2019s not an ass kissing like bohemian rhapsody or Elvis which is good since I find that style annoying as all hell.","Zardoz \u2014 great film, \u201cthe gun is good, the penis is evil!\u201d","There is a good movie about the New Republic called Shattered Glass \ud83e\udd13 and Chloe Sevigny is in it \ud83d\ude0e","Genuinely good idea for a movie.","Sometimes I think about the fire extinguisher in Irreversible and my whole body convulses.

text: ["Looool, \n\nI think everyone, no matter how beautiful, is a naval gazer when it comes to their looks. Especially now with social media platforms and everyone is just visualized it's hard not to compare yourself. The feelings of inferiority are high amongst our youth especially  tbh, but as our great president once eloquently said: it is what it is.","True, but a hell of a lot of ugly people think they\u2019re hot.","What if transmen were exclusively Chads, Simps, Incels, and Neckbeards...","I mean...maybe on paper. I really doubt young girls were volunteering to snitch left and right of their own accord","The army council leaning into the girlboss strategy in the wake of the Long War.","I've seen it on dozens and dozens of tinder profiles by now :/","If anyone showed me this out or in context I would assume the writer was a virgin","Some of them aren't even that quiet about it.  Like 98% of the people in porn/sex work are quite loudly non-monogamous to some degree.  Their literal job is to be hot enough that people pay to cum while thinking of them.","The weird rationalist egirl who every month makes a twitter poll 'do you think it's okay if your girlfriend was visibly disgusted by negroes?'\n\nI guess all egirls are poly in a way actually whoa","I mean, assuming she\u2019s a not a traumatized shell of human being, the wife must get off on the dynamic too in some way. Idk, human sexuality is weird man.","I just like hearing what intelligent women with personality disorders and gay men think about the world","MFs are using performance enhancing drugs to mansplain.\n\nIt\u2019s over for us natty misogynists","Hm loser. I'll keep grinding while you sob about cheaters having an unfair advantage. Trough sheer hardwork and self-belief I'll rise trough the ranks and become the greatest misogynist this world's ever seen. \nJust don't forget that when you finally see me on TV up on the podium receiving my Olympic Gold medal for sexism it wasn't because of luck or performance enhancing drugs. It was because while you were being cordeal to bitches I was out there grinding. \nYou think it's easy always having the last word over a woman regardless of whether I actually have anything to add?\nYou think at end of the day my throat doesn't hurt from spending all day repeating what she just said except in a much more convulated way?\nPff, but I guess not everyone was built for greatness.","Never date a woman with a twitter. Or a man. Its like its designed to make us all classless slobbering morons. This is my only form of social media and \u201csocial\u201d is a very strong word for what takes place here.","I can fix them and you can too. Women love when you dont care about info graph insta nonsense or whatever activism youre supposed to. Its like a mask falls away and they always seem so tired underneath. Genuinely feel bad for them. This woke stuff is set up like a constant exam and the pressure must feel enormous. \n\nI remember a coffee date where this girl kept asking if I knew if the coffee was fair trade who owned the coffee shop etc. I just kept saying I really liked the coffee and she stopped after like five minutes so we had a real conversation. She kept saying stuff like my privilege and all that when referencing what she wanted to do her dreams etc it was truly bizarre to tell her that shit doesnt matter having your dreams and working towards them doesnt mean youre shitting on people. Its a good thing to have your own dreams. She wanted to be an art teacher for kids with mental heath issues. It was such a sweet goal and she kept apologizing for it like she was doing something wrong. By the end of the date she just seemed so shell shocked that someone legit just wanted a conversation and to know about her not test her for nonsense. We texted a bit after but I knew it would never work. She was too far gone and Im not a therapist.","Lol I literally had a girl tell me a few months ago that one of the things she was looking for in a normal guy (ie \"not creepy\" in her words) was an Instagram where he regularly posts and gets a lot of engagement","just remember that there's tons of people out there that legitimately think he's hot","Somalis are in the top 3 of races with ugly men/gorgeous women","Get laid, incel","im not a liberal feminist dumbass. if i had to label myself i would say Marxist feminist",">joined in part because i appreciated the critiques of bourgeois neoliberal feminism\n\n>the vile, shallow, and disgusting comments that men on here make me re-identify with feminism\n\nIn both these cases, you've defined your own thoughts reactively in opposition to an \"other\"","Women prop the sky up on their child-bearing hips","first they came for the misogynists...","I am a disgusting man, but red scare in general and this sub to some degree def made me re-affirm my \"feminism\" insofar as I can be one while (playfully) mocking women",">this sub actually made me re-identify as feminist\n\nThat\u2019s great! \n>however reading the vile, shallow, and disgusting comments that men on here make about women encouraged me to read second wave feminist lit, support the women in my life more, and re-identify with feminism. \n\nThat\u2019s great! \n\n>thank you misogynists, incels, and the like  <3\n\nNp :)","Yea dudes say a lot of stupid short sighted things but it\u2019s their own shortcomings and insecurities, not anything else. These fellas are in for a rough surprise when they realize what they\u2019re missing out on, I view it as the jokes on them. If you wanna be an irrational retard and poison your mind against the other sex go right ahead, you\u2019re shooting yourself in the foot and squandering opportunities for friendship and love (probably the only valuable thing in life).","personally i see less incel comments than i do guys being weird and gross and super judgemental about how women look. i think true incels are relatively rare on here","Idk, I've only ever been called an incel on here by like bloobird or some other comparable schizo. But maybe that's just because my posts are really good and everyone can tell I'm cool and smart.","lol yes it\u2019s the women here that are the problem \ud83d\ude44\n\nthat voyeurs movie sucked though","ancient greeks + romans realised that it's getting your dick sucked that is manly, not sucking dick","I imagine the extreme ones in those subs weren't born women","Similarly, I'm not particularly fond of being a man. Words fail me when I try to express this, but I hate the idea of being the want*er*, the do*er*, the agent of life rather than life's centre. And I hate the idea that if I had been on the Titanic I would have been left to die. Watching animal mating rituals in nature documentaries leaves a pit in my stomach, to think that life and nature degrade the male spirit to the point of having us plead to exist. As Paglia would say, I guess that's why we built society; but all the manmade structures of history won't erase that ineffable spirituality anxiety. It's certainly not rational, but my male intuition tells me many men feel something like this.","Isn't the solution to that actually having feminists and thier positions allowed to be criticised/ questioned by men without being called incels for it?","no that isn\u2019t the solution and you personally are a person that has struggled romantically/sexually and constantly spams dumb articles and \u2018research\u2019 that you think proves it\u2019s not your fault. \n\ni dont get why you don\u2019t think the term incel applies to you and get mad about being called one","It\u2019s that plus a lot of guys have had really negative experiences trying to find a long term partner in the current climate of sex positive, anti-trad, #girlboss shite that we\u2019re never allowed to publicly express our disgust at. \n\nMost of it is just badly articulated frustration at not being able to find love or stability. A lot of men feel attractive women are just using their power to be entitled sociopaths and slobs rather than doing any work for the benefit of society / family. \n\nA typical attractive woman from 10 years ago wasn\u2019t her own social media enterprise and was a lot more accessible as a \u2018mate\u2019. So the pool of decent girls to choose from is getting smaller and smaller. Guys are pissed off about that too. \n\nAnd the whole class based / tech-capitalism shit that all of us should be a lot more unified on as well.","Gurl literally saw one comment about a women's looks and has already made two posts about it, oh and turns out it was a women who posted it. Histrionic airheads like op is the reason why people joke about bad stereotypes for women.","it sounds like you have some internalized misogyny, because your suppositions on what is and isn't important places such little value on what women's work is--healing, nourishing, sustaining life. That's not all of what women are supposed or best situated to do or anything, but women literally carry children. that's the most important thing there is. \n\nbecause you aren't a man, you ultimately don't and will never really know what it's like to be discardable. why do you think the patriarchal power structures are so obsessed with uplifting men? it's because men know on a fundamental, subconscious level that we are ultimately not that important in the life cycle, and that we can be replaced much more easily than women can. women are the center, women are ultimately always, always, always in charge. everything men do culturally is based around women, women are who have shaped how the patriarchy has emerged, because the patriarchal system is ultimately a structuralized system of competition to own and control women, because \"having\" or more accurately being possessively attached to and by women is the ultimately victory in the existence of being a man. \n\nI'm sure men had the leadership roles in your church, but im positive without knowning anything about you that if the women in your church had an agenda they wanted, it got done. even if that desired was facilitated through the men. \n\ni've never talked to a trans guy who was like \"oh wow, i got so much more attention after i transitioned, it's great.\" it's usually the opposite, they are like \"oh i guess people don't actually give a shit anymore\" unless they're in like a business meeting or at work. and yes attention can also suck and negative attention feels bad, but the one thing worse than negative attention is no attention at all. that is what being a man is--a default value of no attention, why do you think we're all so obsessed with it?\n\nanyway, embrace your womanhood it'll get you a lot farther than trying or lusting after being a man, and trust me that you don't actually want that. look at suicide rates for dudes vs women once they hit like 50, it's radically different and that's because *being a man kinda sucks.*","it's because #metoo happened and then we have spent the past 3 years talking about how bad men are, and this is a place where two women have explicitly stated they don't think that's true, and talk about gender all the time.","lucky some of us aren't into fucking loose bootyholes","lol yeah these women are gratuitous and desperate for bravado probably because they're unremarkable in any earnest effort they've ever endeavoured","Its every woman's right to sound like a dumb bitch once in a while.","The girls look hot in this pic.","Were men ever ok? Doesn't seem like it to me.","I would be surprised by this, they seem insecure and like they\u2019d want a 6-7 to make them look better","My kneejerk reaction would be he gets no matches, but I do wonder if the women who make profiles with the exact same vibe give him a shot.

Come on","There\u2019s also the \u201che\u2019s a potential creep and/or predator until proven otherwise, so he could be dangerous\u201d angle that\u2019s really alienating.\n\nThis usually adds fuel to the sense of being seen as a disposable commodity and further alienation. There are no bonds of kinship in modern cosmopolitan life and nobody truly cares whether you live or die. Women usually have very involved and complicated social lives, so this doesn\u2019t happen to them.\n\nBut women have their own unique set of issues, too. It\u2019s not a competition after all.","Nah, plenty  of women understand male loneliness- they\u2019re the ones erased by other women.

Take responsibility for yourself. Learn to fight. Have a weapon or two in your house. Earn money and move to a safe area. Don\u2019t do stupid stuff. These are the things guys have to do. Welcome to it.  Grow up, and then we can discuss your fear of men saying hello.","Yes all women have friend groups it's just an universal truth of life. You're so ignorant","And then we haven't started talking about the millions of women without friend groups","Oh god you're one of those\n\nAnd yes people from 196 countries posting about being hot on the internet is the only society in the world that ever valued looks","True.\n\nI got a sense of this on mdma at the club a few times. just really wanted to dance. every now and then girls would join. most would come and go. some would linger and try and talk to me. i generally wouldnt respond. then some would try again and I'd tell them i need to dance alone. over the course of the night I could feel a couple lurking and learing. it was creepy as fuck and I imagine they weren't used to hearing 'no'.\n\nLater reflected I used to do this to girls myself when I went out, and instantly felt disgusted and had empathy for them swatting away the unrelenting hordes of orbiting losers","Me an ugly woman: I face both, hope this helps.","It takes a lot for a woman to actually be fully ugly. It takes very little for a man to be considered ugly by a large portion of women.","What happened for striving for understanding? I know it\u2019s hard, takes alot of work, but we\u2019re not two separate species. Understanding is possible, but not when our culture treats these issues as personal failings that must be hidden away by the individual. A man with no friends is a looser not worth listening to. A woman with fear is a child. Especially to the opposite sex. No woman wants to date a socially inept man, and no man wants to date someone they have to coddle for everything. So men and women, keep their struggles close to their chest, and put on a brave face. \n\nAnd we continue. \n\nThat said I think men are making some slight progress on this. Just looking at my own life, when I was younger it was still not cool to be affectionate with male friends, today things are different. I regularly get told and tell my male friends how much I love and appreciate them. We hug. We cry in front of each other. We check in on each other. And during none of this do any of us drop a \u201cno homo\u201d, it\u2019s just seen as the right thing to do with a friend. \n\nUnfortunately I think women\u2019s culture has been buying into more fear in the recent period, and with all the news about women-directed-violence, I can\u2019t blame them, that said, when we look at the numbers, we are inching to a better world in this regard. And as men get more sensitive and begin to understand more, this will improve. An example from my life, I used to be one of the guys who would get annoyed when I walked down the street at night and a woman a block away would switch side walks. I know that I\u2019m not going to do anything, and to be treated as an automatic threat really hurt me and my self image. Today after really getting the other side of the story from my partners and female friends, I\u2019m often the one who crosses over on my own. Hell I\u2019ve even been the \u201cbar boyfriend\u201d to strange women when I noticed they were being cornered by some tool. \n\nWill it ever be perfect? Will the sexes ever truly understand each other\u2019s plight? I don\u2019t know, but we should keep trying. Accepting this divide is giving up. Humanity has achieved great things, I think empathy is a realistic goal.","Because if you are an ugly woman men will never approach you to develop romantic relationships with you, you are just one of the guys or at worst they see you as a subcategory of a woman, something that doesn't deserve their niceness. The unwanted sexual attention is how some men will still see you as a fast fuck and want to use you for sex. So you get unwanted sexual attention and you also feel lonely, so nice <3\n\nThank god I like women and I have a gf because women who like women tend to be way more open-minded and focus less on appearance, also my self-confidence in my personality and abilities is great so probably that's a plus for attracting women, but if I was straight I would feel very lonely, unwanted and have very low self-esteem.","Ugly women understand guys just fine","Normalize telling women they're 6s","I've found the easiest way to break their brains is to ask where they keep their gun. \n\nMost women who believe this insanity are dyed in the wool BLOO NO MATTER HOOOOO so they'll tell you they don't have a gun, believe in strong gun control blah blah blah. \n\nOh, you think you're in constant mortal danger every time you step outside but don't think you should be allowed a sidearm? lmfao k\n\nGod created men but Samuel Colt made them equals","Wait till you find out how women who are considered ugly or sexually unappealing to men are treated by society lol","much easier to imagine a woman experiencing a \"male\" feelings of loneliness than a man experiencing \"female\" oversexuality and attention","[I'm a woman and I feel lonely.](http://pm1.narvii.com/7965/837bf1089bb3674bc1da2c6140996e74de629debr1-736-734v2_uhq.jpg)","Yeah, there was a video on the front-page  of a woman pulling a gun on a guy because she felt  he took her parking spot.

Maybe stigmatizing loli hentai will prevent a few pedophiles?","like the other user said:\n\n>Women are the ones setting the standards when it comes to getting laid and starting relationships. They are the ones that reshape our personalities. If a woman responds negatively to some behavior, men who are not socially retarded will drop that behavior and try something else that might work and bit by bit build a personality that doesn't scare every woman in 100 yard radius. Average looking men who are social retards will just bang their heads against the wall and never get any women, will grow bitter and start blaming them.\n\nbut regarding what you said: I don't think it's all about personality with women. Ive been on dating apps and I know for a fact that I have an easier time talking with women irl. In dating apps Im olympically ignored. And that's simply a matter of being good looking, and women still like as few men in there as they can. So I don't think women value personality that much.\n\n>since we are little children that our appearance is the most important thing about us to get a partner\n\ndoesnt explain why so many below average looking women are with partners\n\nand as the user I quoted say: when men open up to women (not trauma dump, simply open), women become desinterested, unless they were already in a relationship","at the hands of male perpetrators\u2026.obviously people want to keep women out of the frenzy of male on male violence","why is it impossible? ugly women feel this \u2018profound\u2019 loneliness all the time","My only guess - since none of them ever murdered you or anything - is that they wanted to see a female face, even if only for an instant, which isn\u2019t the least understandable urge in the world during peak pandemic time when single people were essentially in solitary confinement.",">wholesome girls on Hinge","He's from Wales, he's at least an 9 there.","Well first, it seems this Entrepreneur was using her for exposure.

My version of it was \"are we just more AWARE of the sickos now that we live much more public lives and communicate easier?\"  I think my previous post answers both of our questions though - I really do feel that unfettered access to the most soul-destroying pornography (often times from a VERY young age) is causing us to have to up our ante for what it takes to get a denopamine hit - people need progressively more and more intense pornography to feel what they used to feel.  That tolerance effect is changing the way our brains work - and it's leading to some pretty serious consequences in our culture.","I guess they don\u2019t fuck from a distance.","OH MY GOD. You wouldn\u2019t believe how many times I\u2019ve gotten that!!! Men being extremely disappointed that I\u2019m not a teenager. \n\nI honestly feel like it\u2019s proof that the fetishization of super young women by some men is about the IDEA of her being young, and what it means. People always say men go after younger women because they\u2019re impressionable, easy to manipulate, etc. and people always claim the women who say that are just jealous. \n\nBut it\u2019s TRUE. Like being physically attracted to a 30 year old over a 40 year old is human nature (for both genders) and is indeed usually about just being more aesthetically pleasing. But so many dudes will claim an 18 year old is infinitely hotter than a 27 year old, and I am living proof that this is usually just about the idea of a girl being young. Lots of seemingly normal guys seem to like the idea of a girl being even way younger than 18, like as young as 13. It\u2019s absolutely about dominance/control/lack of being intimidated. \n\nThese people are way more common than you\u2019d imagine, too. \n\nI got a bag on clearance from urban outfitters a few years back for like $5. It looks kinda like a middle schooler\u2019s backpack tbh. \n\nWhen I walk down the street wearing it, I get catcalled like 5x as much.\n\nSo you can\u2019t claim it\u2019s about skin texture or the shape of your body or whatever else because you get literally the exact same woman and when people THINK she\u2019s adolescent they\u2019re turned on. It isn\u2019t about actually looking younger/healthier. \n\nLike I just despise these people who claim it\u2019s about fertility or whatever. I minored in anthro and could ramble about this for hours, but something people don\u2019t know is that the healthiest age for a woman to mother, biologically- the absolute peak- is actually 26, on average. It\u2019s when estrogen peaks and hips are fully developed. Mid/late 20s are when people are at their most naturally fit to parent. And when you don\u2019t control for socioeconomic factors, like whether people are married, on a decent diet, income, etc, it\u2019s 32 in the US!!!! So biologically we peak at 26 but decline much more slowly than people claim. \n\nAnother thing is that men age at approx the same rate as women, reproductively. Above 35, risks of all sorts of things surge. So men and women are probably both hardwired by our lizard brains to be most just viscerally, primitively attracted to people in their mid/late 20s. \n\nSo if a man consistently only dates when in their 20s, sure I\u2019ll think he\u2019s kinda shallow but I\u2019ll believe that it\u2019s about losing sexual attraction towards his partner. Of course life, humans, and relationships are infinitely more complex and nuanced than this, and we seem to be mostly naturally wired to be together with one mate for a surprisingly long time, years to lifelong. But I\u2019m just saying, yes, I get why a 25 yo woman is just objectively hotter than that same woman at 35 (usually). \n\nBut men\u2019s lizard brains are NOT more tuned to be into late teens > late 20s. But it\u2019s a very common phenomenon in our society. \n\nIt\u2019s 100% something societal/psychological that makes so many guys soooo into girls who wouldn\u2019t even be able to physically bear children without breaking several bones. \n\nIt\u2019s vulnerability.","The schema so many people have in their minds of male/female dynamics is a predator/prey thing.

Their brains just light up when they think they\u2019ve identified an easy target. \n\nThere\u2019s a reason women playing dumb to attract men is a thing. \n\nIt\u2019s absolutely cultural, not instinctual. A woman (or girl) being powerless and at his whim and mercy is a frighteningly common trope & prevalent complex.","This is why arranged marriage is better than dating","No ugly women are living alone in a cabin in the woods.","nah no amnesty for women.","Do you know what it\u2019s like to be penetrated by someone you\u2019re not attracted to?

It's not an 'either or' situation. It's a combination of both - the ultimate expression of femininity; sensuality and virtue in equal measure.

It is 100% obviously sour grapes over not having sex as readily, and people trying to tell you different are gaslighting I STG","No, it's because they believe - rightly or wrongly - that people who have had a lot of casual sex before are likely to want to do it in the future, so it's a hedge against infidelity. Men cheat too (IDK the stats but I'd guess men cheat more), but women don't ever doubt that her child is hers, because it came out of her. Men don't have that assurance.","You have no idea how hot it is to fuck a girl who hates your genotype","Maybe? Ive met a lot of people with high body counts who tend to keep their flings and exes around as friends. No one wants to deal with that.","high body count in girls is very unattractive.  Sorry for this uncomfortable truth, society lies to you.","I like chill men because they mellow me out by proxy. Please leave some in the pool for the women who appreciate them if you do not.","I don\u2019t really give a fuck about body count but I am jealous that straight women and gay men have free sex on tap while straight men and lesbians have to climb a fucking mountain for it.","It\u2019s what whores do!!","Yeah people def change as they grow older. A lot of my friends who had casual sex in college regret it now and some of my friends don\u2019t care. It really depends on the person!","I don't like people who type like tweens talking about how much they're fucking","Just block em babes, they'll get it","Yeah. It\u2019s like that specific type of imagined voyeurism. They watch two people having sex on a screen so often that they can\u2019t help but imagine it with others in real life, even if the scenario is an innocent date. Very weird how it warps the brain into this weird cuckhold scenario..","May be true for you, but this is not common. Most girls subconsciously want to get something in return for sex, which is commitment from a man they admire. \n\nI highly doubt you had multiple casual sex relationships and didn\u2019t regret a single one, as if you and all the men were saints trading momentary intimacy like it was merchandise. May happen a couple times, but not regularly.","You're right; only ugly people should pay tax","It\u2019s actually cool and trendy to be a virgin now. Try to keep up pal.","These fitness fellas are such fucking weirdos, doubly so if they're extremely online. They lowkey want to fuck themselves.","It\u2019s just ego boosting so they can have the hardest nut ever tonight","Yeah exactly lol, only people who haven\u2019t been out in the real world could buy some shit like this, AKA Gen Zers who focus more on ideology than real life dynamics.\n\nShe sounds like a pretty conscientious person who has found success in her life, from her discussion of work, family life and moving countries. To quote Robert Henlein, \u201cMan is not a rational animal, but a rationalizing animal\u201d. \n\nIt serves her well to rationalize that her previous sexual relationships have no negative effects on her present or future with her husband. A man she will begin to lose respect for in the immediate future btw","most of them seem to wanna fuck other men. which is fine, but they don\u2019t do it and get angry at everyone else","I support virgins marrying virgins, they should be honest about their no pussy status tho","\n\u201eNo anti-porn feminist I know has suggested that there is one image, or even a few, that could lead a non-rapist to rape; the argument, rather, is that taken together, pornographic images create a world that is at best inhospitable to women, and at worst dangerous to their physical and emotional well-being. In an unfair and inaccurate article that is emblematic of how anti-porn feminist work is misrepresented, Daniel Bernardi claims that Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon believed that \u201cwatching pornography leads men to rape women.\u201d Neither Dworkin nor MacKinnon \u201cpioneers in developing a radical feminist critique of pornography, saw porn in such simplistic terms. Rather, both argued that porn has a complicated and multilayered effect on male sexuality, and that rape, rather than simply being caused by porn, is a cultural practice that has been woven into the fabric of a male-dominated society. Pornography, they argued, is one important agent of such a society since it so perfectly encodes woman-hating ideology, but to see it as simplistically and unquestionably leading to rape is to ignore how porn operates within the wider context of a society that is brimming with sexist imagery and ideology. If, then, we replace the \u201cDoes porn cause rape?\u201d question with more nuanced questions that ask how porn messages shape our reality and our culture, we avoid falling into the images-lead-to-rape discussion. What this reformulation does is highlight the ways that the stories in pornography, by virtue of their consistency and coherence, create a worldview that the user integrates into his reservoir of beliefs that form his ways of understanding, seeing, and interpreting what goes on around him.\u201c","\u201eAnti-feminism is also operating whenever any political group is ready to sacrifice one group of women, one faction, some women, some kinds of women, to any element of sex-class oppression: to pornography, to rape, to battery, to economic exploitation, to reproductive exploitation, to prostitution. There are women all along the male-defined political spectrum, including both extreme ends of it, ready to sacrifice some women, usually not themselves, to the brothels or the farms. The sacrifice is profoundly anti-feminist; it is also profoundly immoral\u2026\u201c Andrea Dworkin Anti-feminism,\" Right Wing Women (1983), pp. 230-231.","Keep looking for flaws and cracks. Whatever makes you feel good about yourself my dude.","Turns out you can have a lot of life experience and not be a whore","What has this woman done to piss people off so much?","So I\u2019ve only been with two people. Had full on relationships with two people. My relationship history is really weird so I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right person to ask this. \n\nOne was an on and off relationship for ten years that was toxic. Another was for 2-3 months before he got arrested and went to prison for 20 years. But for the latter, it moved fast but didn\u2019t feel wrong and we vibed a lot.","\"Yes, feelings are meant to be felt! Amirite, girls? I get it!\" Men pandering to women like this is just manipulative behavior. It's The Game for soft boys.","Literally any woman that\u2019s not hideous can walk into a bar and find a sexual partner in an hour. Very few men can do that regularly. for a man to be able to do that it shows there\u2019s something special about him. For a woman it just shows she\u2019s not disfigured. Resentment plays a part sure and all this discourse is fake and gay but it\u2019s a reality.","Why do you feel such a need to have children that you\u2019d marry someone who you\u2019re neither attracted to nor emotionally invested in? \n\nIt sounds like a great way to make yourself miserable. Eventually you or your spouse are likely to pursue extramarital affairs, thereby destroying the fragile union that brought you together in the first place.","Yeah. People with low body counts keeping their exes as close friends is also weird. Unless you have a kid together it\u2019s time to move on and make other friends preferably ones you haven\u2019t fucked","I posted on another thread about how the OKCupid stats were generally incel/femcel fuel, so this is a great spot to prove it.\n\n[Always were](https://theblog.okcupid.com/undressed-how-progressive-are-millennials-when-it-comes-to-paying-the-bill-6f8e8b91a7bf), the only thing that's changed I think is that you're seeing more leftwing people digesting the base points of the incel mythos without it having being flagged as an \"incel\" talking point.\n\nTo be clear, I believe the majority of this shit is that online dating is hellworld for literally anybody of any gender, age, color, etc. People just take that and assume it's the same thing in real life.","Wouldn\u2019t this just be because of a correlation between religious people having low body counts and religious people being more likely to stick with marriage?","Yeah. You can tell it\u2019s jealousy because what a guy deems as high is heavily related to what his own count is. I met a guy who had like 30, good looking guy and he said anything below that was low lol. Whereas a virgin guy will be put off by any woman who\u2019s been fucked at all",">Is this all just a form of Nietzschean ressentiment? Straight guys are repressing their jealously that they cannot have multiple sex partners by flipping things to \"well having multiple sex partners is a sign of immorality / a diminished life\"?\n\nIt is ressentiment but it's absolutely not a \"straight guy\" thing. I have a way higher body count than my fiancee and she still seethes about it both explicitly and covertly.","Lol, \u201cshe\u201d is either a Tate-ortot, or a woman who fell deeply into the redpill. Like look at her other comments. They\u2019re like something a Podcast Dweeb an AI would generate. \n\nI\u2019m a woman who was raised in Mormon Utah. I\u2019m 28. 15 years ago- okay, maybe a little closer to 10- I came across this bullshit. It was honestly straight up sad.",],

text: ["Yeah there's something intuitively hollow and tautological about any kind of appeal to identity via \"who I really am,\" \"born this way,\" etc. \n\nI'm sure you can find an awesome and more succinct breakdown of this by someone else, but the major problem lay in the fact that it contrives a kind of consumerism for every level of being that you are, instead of just relegating it to the most superficial market relationship you can have to the world. \n\nAnd Ironically it obscures the real nature of that consumerism as somehow solely the product of your own individual willpower and desire to self actualize, and not also determined by the prior blueprint of validation set out for you by the masses.","this is the explanation the \"zoomers are doomed\" faction are too scared to accept","The \u201cI don\u2019t know who needs to hear this\u201d schtick is one of the most grating e-phrases out there. Borne purely from a 50/50 mix of millennial angst and insecurity. \n\nBut everything else here is right","TikTok is nowhere close to as bad as Twitter.","Even my best, most jaded and based friends somehow rate Banksy. Sometimes i just want to lay in bed until the sun sets. I'm not depressed, I just enjoy watching dudes on youtube explaining why they are obsessed with medieval swords even though I think it's a weird hobby. I don't move a lot except from my left to my right side. Before I know it the day is over. Afterwards I feel guilty.","Taking ethics classes in undergrad made me dumber. People under 25 shouldn't even know what ethics means.","The funny thing is this would make them more popular as the average person just doesn't care but would like to follow someone whose mom was their fave in a sitcom. Or a rich parent meaning the parasocial relationship is so much opulent and high class.\n\nZoomers have already leapfrogged this issue by going viral explicitly for being a famous person's kid. 'pics of my mum in the 90s' and it's a big deal celeb lol and they get 300k likes for it.\n\nEvery milennial problem is solved by zoomers by pushing through fully into the abyss.","Things change when you graduate high school","Yeah I remember all of the \u2018no social media is a red flag\u2019 articles from back in like 2012 - 2014 and nowadays not having social media is seen as a sign of being well adjusted.","It\u2019s legitimately hard to find someone without tiktok between the ages of 18-25.","Yeah I dunno, that pales in comparison to the impacts of modern smartphones","There was a pic on r/gaming or r/pics of a manchild and his three offspring sitting at a long desk all playing PC games. Unsure if they were playing together but it looked incredibly disconnected and pathetic. Most of the comments were typical reddit, \"FAITH IN HUMANITY RESTORED!\" or \"PARENTING GOALS!\"","I can't wait to offer absolutely nothing to my children","Simple things like capeshit and video games make them happy. They have families and people who love them and they will probably die knowing they had a fulfilling life. Pretty cringe if you ask me.","ratio'd from butthurt?\n\nThere's good reason to curate your kids' entertainment consumption.\n\nBut I often see it done in a self-unaware way. Your kids are not good vessels to be extensions of your FANDOMS. \n\nIf you want your kids to listen to bands you like, then listen to it how you normally would, and if it works for them, they might pick it up. If you have a good relationship with your kid, this works better. If your kid feels pressure to take on your tastes as identity to keep you happy, that's kind of abusive imo and I hope it backfires on you. \n\nThere is no reason to inculcate purely superficial taste in your kids other than your own selfishness.\n\nAnd there's really no *time* for it.  You're supposed to be teaching them virtues and values and giving them tools to navigate this world. That shit takes forever to teach. \n\nYou're not supposed to spend that time creating super consumers; little stans that you can geek out about your nostalgia bands with and then show off your little soy fan on social media. Your kids are not accessories or emotional viagra so you can keep masturbating about your glory days.","I forgot about this weird aspect of high school era friendship. Where dudes would be like \u201cdid you see _____\u201d id be like \u201coh yeah\u201d and then they\u2019d quote something that i either didn\u2019t remember from it or just didn\u2019t know what to say in response, other than to fake laugh or be like \u201chaha yeah i remember that part\u201d? Man that sucked. Dudes at work still try that with me once in a great while. \u201cDo you watch it\u2019s always sunny????\u201d","it seems cognitively and emotionally healthy for a kid to feel passionate about a piece of media and capitalize on that passion by memorizing all the lines, playing with toys themed around them, talking about it with other kids\u2026it\u2019s also cute lol","\n\u201cThe importance of Liking Yourself is a notion that fell heavily out of favor during the coptic, anti-ego frenzy of the Acid Era--but nobody guessed back then that the experiment might churn up this kind of hangover: a whole subculture of frightened illiterates with no faith in anything.\u201d\n\u2015 Hunter S. Thompson, Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72","Point is if he knows he\u2019s an older millennial he should know that these things that came 5-10 years after him are millennial, not \u201cGen Z\u201d lol","Sounds like you've bought into the conventional ethos of western hedonism.\n\nReminds me of Nietzsche's last man.\n\nThe Buddhists are right about the pursuit of pleasure,  there is no attaining pleasure,  just replacing one hunger with another.\n\nPeople that give up,  surrender to their circumstances,  and behave in ways that are defeatist arent attractive.\n\n\"I dont want to raise kids in this world\"  is just marketing for 'i dont want to be a dad' and that's fine,  but it's also exactly what I'm talking about.","As someone who refuses to use twitter or discord, I see what they mean. \n\nAnything funnier is coming from people I can\u2019t  actually relate to in any real way beyond that I think they are funny.","Sort of troubled how influenced people are by the internet. It's just spooky and not a total win.","It's got the same issue as the rest of terminally online discourse. Any of the people who are actually worth listening to for any given topic aren't terminally online. They're actually out there doing shit with their lives.","But it doesnt interfere with your desires and passions, unless you have like the very specific desire of being \"the worlds fastest/strongest human\" or something. What you are stating, is fallacious.","90% of it is people trying to answer the question of what to do in the face of total defeat, they just have different conceptions of what exactly it is that's so defeated. It's all a manifestation of the complete  powerlessness with which we're all faced.","I used to be heavily into the gaming sphere on Twitch but nowadays I pretty much just watch musicians on it, very relaxing and good vibes to watch some chick playing piano/guitar/harp/whatever and you don't get 20 000 idiot sperg children in the chat so there's an actual sense of community.","Anyone who is extremely offline can literally do no wrong.","man I've never had FB or Twitter and I'm pretty sure I'm 10000% happier than whoever got involved in this drama on either side. am I SMARTER? nah. is the country absolutely fucked beyond measure? yeah. but I feel really good about it. the important thing is if I want to be mad I do it on my own schedule. if I go look at some shitty clickbait article and get mad, that was my own fault. that shit is junk food, it needs to be consumed in moderation. these people have fatty cerebrum disease.","Yea, i think that's what anyone dismissing these needs to take into consideration. This is very good for a teenager","I think it's more how you talk about it. \n\nThere's a way to talk about it and retain your dignity.\n\nIt's the overshare that's tough.","A lot of these people need therapists not an echo chamber of immature fools like we have in the above example.","I saw some post mentioning this in earnest and self-professed children were commenting how scared and stressed they were\n\nlike go do your homework. go sneak booze out your parent\u2019s liquor cabinet. go play video games with your friends until 4am. wtf","The older I get, the more infuriating it is to see people being fake.","Lol I just feel like a freak for having run out like that instead of toughing it out. I was 16 though so I will forgive myself","You sound like a virgin gamer *glance at history* yeah checks out","Or I can nitpick and also examine myself. Since then, I've realized that I was subconsciously sabotaging the relationship by continually pressing on our disagreements, partly because I just truly wasn't that into her anymore but also because I have commitment issues, largely stemming from abandonment/inadequacy problems in childhood. I saw that a higher level of commitment/self-sacrifice was required to work through our differences and my egocentric aversion-oriented ass just bailed. But thanks so much for your kind encouragement and support, stranger","Agreed. It boggles my mind. On tiktok it\u2019s out of control\u2026 Didn\u2019t realize the bar for being severely mentally I\u2019ll was so low, and am confused why everyone seems to *want* to have problems? Back in my day we just wanted to be hot and normal","I think this is interesting and I have noticed this somewhat myself. Here are a couple of my reflections\n\n1) People today have seemingly no resilience. They can't stick with things and they hang up their hats at the first signs of hardship. \n\n2) People are extremely fatalistic. I think people today have a very scientifically deterministic worldview that borders on nihilism. I feel like you can hear this when young people talk. \"Do you know what this is doing to our brains?\" It is always brains or hormones or some kind of genetic disposition. They never feel that they have any choice in the matter.\n\n3) Karenization. Everyone thinks (probably mostly correctly) that the way to get ahead in society is by speaking to the manager and leveraging various discourses relating to mental health to try to work the system for any advantage they can find in a world where the proverbial pie is shrinking.","Viewing depression and love in terms of \u2018chemicals in your brain\u2019 is deeply nihilistic. It makes me Ted-brained thinking about it.","I wouldn't know about the love part, but considering that depression is recognized to be in large part caused by chemical imbalances independent of your external conditions, why is considering that nihilistic?\n\nYou wouldn't say that operating on or even amputating an infected limb is nihilistic (one assumes) so why is much less extreme treatment considering an \"infected\" brain any different?","This is very interesting thanks for sharing! I'm looking forward to see more research come out from the perspective of psychologists/people who work in mental health care about how the internet is changing how people perceive and deal with their mental illnesses","Yeah Also I think being mentally ill is trendy ? Tiktok ended up being worse than Tumblr or reddit...","I don't really disagree that there's a culture surrounding mental health that's ultimately damaging to those who are suffering and that it largely stems from internet culture. And I definitely think people pathologize completely normal behaviour and reactions but I also think some of what you're describing is fairly standard for the mentally ill.\n\n>They have no contextual understanding how minor inconveniences can and SHOULD be resolved quietly to themselves by being a little anxious for a night\n\nI've been on psych wards and I don't see how this is unusual. The inability to process emotions and minor inconveniences is a sign of mental illness.\n\nPeople losing friendships over what they perceive to be a lack of support is also standard.\n\nYou are viewing your patients through a jaded, internet-culture influenced lens (which is fair but I mean, it's also your job to provide support)\n\nAll of what you've described are signs of people who are deeply unwell, whatever the cause.\n\nHow do you know someone can hold a job down if they haven't? \n\nPeople who should otherwise be functional and are failing because they feel they are in crisis and can't keep friends or their jobs are certainly ill and in need of some kind of help, even if they're extremely annoying or you disagree with them on whatever.\n\nI don't know, if you feel this way about the people you're supporting, perhaps you should be in a different line of work.","Good point, everyone seeks some form of validation in life, this really isn\u2019t different, it\u2019s just no longer about self or societal improvement.","Bit weird to link me to a nihilistic viewpoint when I am not making nihilistic claims - I was asking why thinking your brain state can be chemically influenced (as is trivially obvious to anyone who knows of the existence of alcohol and other addictions) is nihilistic?\n\nWould it also be hypocritical to read a diagram on a computer screen explaining how the computer works, since that would be trusting chemicals in the computer telling me they're chemicals in the computer?","Hey OP, great post. I'm technically Gen Z  I guess (1998?) starting an MSc in Psychology soon as a conversion from political theory so it's nice to have both perspectives (as I think you offered quite rightly here, as have commenters).\n\nWhat are your thoughts on identity formation in the age we're in now? Do these diagnoses offer people some kind of (false) clarity as to who they are?\n\nI might be wrong but I think it's also easy to see how people would try and grab the respite they can from existing under late-capitalism. I.e., if there's a discourse which says 'we must look after these abc oppressed groups', I can see the appeal of 'finding' something within yourself which puts you in a protected category. Just my 2p worth.","why do none of you have a materialist analysis lol. \u201coh noo the zoomers are becoming less and less virtuous because their minds are weak and they should just suck it up!\u201d it\u2019s definitely not an expected reaction to increasing social atomisation and hyper-capitalist alienation in the age of spectacle\u2026 couldnt be that could it\u2026 why are we scolding people who are the demographic the left seeks to liberate\u2026","Appreciate your insight here. I\u2019m an older millennial and I cannot get over how many peers disclose their various mental illness (self) diagnoses to complete strangers. Like you pointed out, it has become an identity (and a complete replacement for a personality for some).\n\nDoes anyone else think therapists enable some of their patients? I gave up on therapy entirely after I told my therapist I wanted to lose weight (I\u2019m objectively obese - this wasn\u2019t like body dysmorphia or something) and she told me losing weight might make me unhappy, and why do that? The focus isn\u2019t to make you \u201cbetter\u201d - it\u2019s to keep you coming back. \n\nAlso we never seem to address the link between mental health and diet. When I eat clean and exercise, depression and anxiety nearly vanish. I know that is not the case for everyone, but I just feel like more people should understand that link.","The reasons are many. It\u2019s not entirely true that everyone wanted to be normal. For example,  people thread depression as something sophisticated, attractive, mysterious. The difference is that in the past,  culture and society by a  opposed the antisocial movements and behaviors. If you wanted to be considered a valuable member of the society and admired, you should have been fairly educated, resourceful, healthy, have a good job etc.\n\nPeople always wanted to feel special to be different, unique and to achieve something that is hard to achieve. \n\nIt\u2019s just now this system, decade after decade, get screwed, by all the acceptance movements and compassion leeches that push their wrong doing onto other people. Since, you know, being a loser is not your fault, is the world that is at wrong here. And internet only accelerated this, because you can easily find other groups of fuck up that will say exactly what you want to hear.\n\nAnd  mental illness is a sign that you are special, that you have worse and have to fight everyday, and let\u2019s you act like awful and say that you have mental health problems when you get called out.","Can I ask how old you are?

I\u2019m a training psychologist who works with primarily zoomers/millennials right now, and thoughts similar to these have been percolating in my mind, just haven\u2019t had the words yet.

The thing is, every action they could take is thought to be impossible because of \u201cdepression\u201d when in actuality they are facing the very typical experience of human suffering, which is a universally provisioned experience. \u201cMy depression is acting up this week\u201d God I hate that phrase.","i feel like a lot of this comes from the rise of astrology with younger ppl. it lets them pretend like their flaws are just part of who they are and they\u2019ll always be like that idk","There's an interesting diversity of opinions on mental illness and therapy on this sub. I think you are on to something re: trauma and lack of accountability. Like other psychoanalytic/dynamic concepts, trauma is now an influential feature of general discourse. People are keen to deploy it in any number of scenarios. That's a bad thing and enables people to transform normal adversity into...I don't know? Something else. Something stupid. And without accountability literally nothing will change. But this is precisely what many people desire. They want to *feel* better. They do not want to change. They want a little band aid. I was depressed for like 5 years and didn't start to get better at all until I accepted responsibility for myself. I remember reading in Bruce Fink's \"A Clinical Introduction to Lacanian Psychoanalysis\" that people actually get something out of their pathology. Otherwise why would they keep it around? I was like \"holy shit! He's right!\"","I have been working with this theory that the reason people latch onto things like minority gender identity, sexual identity and mental health diagnosis is because we deeply have a culture where people - nobody - truly feels like they belong. we all feel out of place, unwelcome, uncared about, at least or especially during younger years like school and the nuclear family. Just at a deep level And yet at the same time we have placed this huge emphasis on creating a culture of belonging for these specific marginalized groups. And so people at some level feel like if they don't belong as they are, this is the reason - and becoming part of one of these groups may give them the satisfaction of finally feeling known, seen, appreciated, whatever. I do understand it seems really toxic, but I think I have more compassion thinking about the \"why\" behind it.","The more an app encourages you to relinquish your healthy sense of privacy and boundaries for other people\u2019s entertainment, the more porous and emotionally vulnerable you become."," the normals are actually on tiktok and its the complaining old ppl on the internet that are not cool","It's so hard to find a therapist who knows what they're doing, is willing to challenge you, and ignore the contempt they feel for some of the things you say.",">I firmly believe that the words we use to describe life, ourselves in particular, are super important in forming our subconscious impressions\n\nGreat argument in favour of wokescolding, too.","Just don't let your kid on devices.

It's a bunch of people with a boomer mindset who are incapable of empathizing or being compassionate about anything. They are literally just saying \"pull yourself up by your bootstraps\".

That\u2019s the liberal assumption, that you *must* go to therapy and it *must* work everyone. It does work for a lot of people but not all the time. Tribal societies in South American cultures and African primitive communities helped lift individuals out of depression through song and dance in a collective group. Western therapy can fail individuals as it\u2019s very atomised and ignores key elements of self transformation and social relations.

The aforementioned ambivalence and ambiguity was one of the show\u2019s strongest suits.  Talk therapy, like everything else, is directly and indirectly influenced by the socio-political zeitgeist.  I don\u2019t think Chase and the writers were going after psychiatry/talk therapy/etc, specifically, but I do think they were pointing out that the logical endpoint of psychoanalysis (professional or otherwise) is obsessive self-regard and solipsism and that contemporary psychiatry is the most prominent instrument of that apparatus.  More broadly, I think the overarching theme of the show, and the reason it resonates so deeply with people (because most shows are about people learning and growing), is that people will choose to elaborately justify their worst impulses and generate pity for themselves before they make concerted efforts to change the things they subconsciously hate about themselves.","Which is to be depressed, alone, lazy, isolated, disconnected, FAT, and unhealthy.

Posting here is antithetical to that kind of validation, and while it\u2019s easy to shit on tiktokers/YouTubers for being/producing brain dead content I\u2019d say odds are there are more socially intelligent people who use it than use Reddit\u2026 but like I said I\u2019m not completely sure. Text heavy apps like this one and Twitter versus image heavy apps like IG and tiktok engender users who gravitate towards different aspects of what socializing through social media is, one being more emotional, flattering, and dynamic versus the other being analytical, contextual, and static but what that does is make it so that the social perceptions of the groups who use them cease contact with each other. Idk why but I\u2019m inclined to believe someone who can show their life off on IG (without a mentally ill obsession with perfection) is much better adjusted to living it versus someone who talks about/posts about it here\u2026 it\u2019s hard to explain idek if I\u2019m making sense","I feel like substance abuse versus internet abuse are spiritually/essentially different, the addiction pathways are still entrenched in their minds but being an information junkie for variably useful knowledge and a nerd who likes to get shitfaced are inextricably different, it goes back to the intellectual inferiority someone less disciplined","> Humans have been the exact same for hundreds of thousands of years.

Let's also go after the other things too right? Oh wait, but why are most of the nerds spamming about TikTok silent on other activities addictive for the brain? \n\nStop trying to make this about saving children's brain health when it is clear you're not.

Be upfront with that and say \"I want TikTok removed because China bad\" as it is clear this is really not about brain health.","Definitely wasn't, by the time TikTok became popular (during the pandemic) the sorts of perks tech offered were not remotely close to what we saw from the 2014-2019 era of things.\n\nThis is just a zoomer trying to act like she has it made in the way millennials had it, when things were already notably on the decline.","I didn't have a smartphone or my own computer until I was 16 and I'm pretty glad. I hated it at the time but I understand now.","My entire point is I don't think the average person wants to kill himself or wants/needs to go to therapy.

I appreciate your response.","Diff user but I'll share my view on it as I've dealt with depression myself. \n\nIt's about accepting that life sucks and almost rejoicing in it. The default in life is suffering, so relish every good thing you have, including the very basics such as breathing. \n\nWith depression you have to nudge your mental lens of life, little by little, away from the negativity. And a big part of that, if not the most crucial, is accepting and embracing the fact that life is shit.\n\nYou need to view \"life is shit\" as a universal fact \u2014 not universal as in held by all, but as a literal fundamental law of the universe, in physics terms. And that even still being able to breathe is a damn blessing. \n\nThen sit with the realization that your thoughts are just thoughts and wasting more time on counterproductive poison (depression) is the worst path to take.\n\nSo you look at the other path, which sucks too but a whole lot less, and you embrace it, because at least there's a little light at the end of that one.\n\nSo once you accept that whatever situation you're in is an irreversible truth, and that rumination is the worst path to take, then you work on fixing it. Because that's the only other option. \n\nYou gotta view depression not as something you deserve, or an inevitable conclusion, but as an insidious monster specifically designed to make you doubt yourself, sabotage yourself, and most of all, make you think there's zero chance of escape. \n\nDon't listen to it. Life's shit, yeah, but that's a fact of the universe, and you do have the freedom to succumb or spit in its face.\n\n~\n\nEdit:\n\nThis is why meditation helped me a lot!! It's like building a muscle with lifting. Keeps you in the present more than the default of your mind is, which is ultimately what you're looking for \u2014 little pulls in the right direction over and over and over again. There's so much repetition that it sucks, but you just gotta embrace it man. \n\nLife is like a caved in tunnel. Your only path worth considering is the slow and agonizing one with the pickaxe.

Most of us are nearly there.","[H o m o c a p i t a l i s m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_capitalism)","I don't think it's advanced it as an ideological and/or moral project, it's advanced it as a side effect of the creation of urban international tourist environments and their associated art production and service economy. The breakdown of community and tradition and the redefinition of the individual tend to follow the creation of such environments rather than motivate them.",">\"glimpse behind the curtain\"\n\nit's literally a single reddit comment that copy+pasted a single out-of-context line from wikipedia\n\nMarxism has already considered the faults of electoralism and bourgeois democracy. To reduce these critiques to \"umm akctually CIA plant\" is pea-brained. It's a distraction from the actual flaws of the system, as though if he *wasn't* appointed, his leadership would be beyond reproach. \n\nYou can believe that he was elected in a way which was entirely legal and above-board, and *still* believe that the system is unjust. There's no illuminati, no Masonic council, no individual who *decided* the outcome of any given federal election in US history. If that's the extent of your anti-capitalism, you're retarded.   \n\nThe truth is a lot more boring. Money in politics, gerrymandering, first-past-the-post, a complicit media system, an elitist education system, etc.  \n\nThe curtain doesn't need to be pulled back. There's no need for conspiracies. It's all right there in front of us.","Society","You can't be a 'socialist' and still be asking extremely basic and leading questions like this...\n\nEven putting aside Marx, it's been well documented that wages have stagnated while production and corporate profits have skyrocketed in North America since the the 50s. That doesn't absolve failchildren who grew up with all of the advantages and connections in the world who squandered them, and adopt a Marxist aesthetic out of resentment, but broad strokes the answers are pretty obvious.","we live in a society","Neoclassical Dolezalist Thought","Okay, but even if the ecological stuff isnt inherently Marxist. It's not inherently right wing ... idc about the labels, but one can be post leftist without embracing reactionary stuff just to feel something lol\n\nAnd you know what? As much as deep ecologists have clashed with the left, beyond people on twitter or something no right wing populist has done anything ecologically good.  We dont end up with basedtedk1488 in office we get people like Bolsonaro or Trump,  and you're dreaming if you think those people are good for the environment.  \n\nYeah marxists deny a lot of major ecological issues like the very idea of overpopulation. Or non anthropocentrism.  Doesnt mean u need to immediately embrace the party that is pro drilling for oil in all thr nature reserves and national parks","Yeah I think that this is the main thing besides social disapproval that made me uninterested in voting trump.  Dems suck for the environment but being marginally less rapacious gives us more time to act.  I care about those small lesser evil things when it comes to ecology.  Foreign policy wise trump may have been better but besides being my tax money why does that affect me ???","I could make the argument that \"ecologism\" is inherently conservative. Not in the political sense that we're familiar with, but in the language used - and the underlying impulse - it absolutely is. \n\nConservation. Conserve. Don't cut down that forest. Don't dig up that land. Leave it be. What's more \"conservative\" than that?\n\nI'm not so sure it's true that no political conservative has never done anything ecologically good (think Teddy Roosevelt, hell, even Nixon). \n\nI'm not defending a political position here, just pointing out that the left and right and their pet causes tend to be very slippery and have changed quite a bit throughout history.","Just say communism will be necessary, why not go the whole hog?","Marcuse wanted to make an elevated human that was incapable of surviving under capitalism, and would thus rail against it.\n\nHere are his ideas coming to fruition in real terms, even if it's not going the way he intended.","Conservation corps, but everybody has to do a year after highschool in the public school defense force.\n\nThey learn to fortify entrances, create checkpoints, fill out range cards, and clean rifles.","Compulsory *anything* violates like half this country's twisted civic dogma. Y'all say you would want this, but I bet if it picked up any kind of actual steam the mood here would also shift on mandatory labor under the united states government.","Make it so out of high school everyone gets 2 free years of community college or they do 2 years mandatory conservation corps service, or military service. If they fail out of school they transfer to the corps. It would be like the military where they get housing, food, and insurance plus a monthly stipend.\n\nIf they get accepted to any 4 year school they can do that instead.\n\nAll of our young people need to be getting educated or getting work experience that's not some shitty minimum wage job that does nothing to help the country.","> I bet you imagined some white men building the hoover dam - yeah, they're all dead and their America and their civics are long gone.\n\nthose guys grew up on farms and shit. they knew how to work and that's why it worked back then. it would be an unmitigated disaster today.","The original civilian conservation corps from 1933 actually provided food, shelter, in addition to ~$1k per month adjusted for inflation. \n\nPeople on this sub don\u2019t like AOC but she specifically has advocated for this in a \u201ccivilian climate corps\u201d proposal","100%. \n\nI believe a good chunk of European countries that have mandatory service also offer a community service option instead. \n\nThat should be the default.","Mao made all the rich university kids go and do manual labor in the countryside for a while. The idea was that being among the common people for a while would give a much better understanding of their life and problems than just reading a lot of theory. Like 10% of the urban population was resettled and a bunch stayed, it was really messy. Ultimately led to a much more cohesive society though, arguably had positive long-term societal effects","Like mandatory americorp? Shit I'm 31 but I'd join for a year if there was real money and effort put behind it.","I was in SF and to be a conscript officer all you need is a high school diploma but you also have to serve longer and your training is longer and you get paid. Realistically only poor ppl do it. I had a m. Eng, my buddies were a lawyer and a dude with a PhD, all of us Raider Ncos. The camaraderie is non existent in the regular army.","It used to be that way, for example in my father's time he was immediately placed as a conscript officer for the AF cuz he had a PhD, but back then everyone served 2 years no matter what so I guess it made more sense for people.","There are states with much happier and low stress populations.\n\nHaving robust supply of housing so that housing approaches costs of materials and maintenance and not driven by scarcity would be a big help. Having less stress and violence in our society in general would probably help. Having better education system that has a respected and reasonable path towards towards blue collar work, like what you see in some European systems, would probably be a good addition.\n\nAmericans work really hard. Not Chinese hard, but they do work really hard, they have few rights in a place of employment, and they generally feel squeezed by society, which makes them stress and seethe, something that happens far less in Europe.\n\nI don't think implementing all the solutions we see in Europe is very likely, I think it's more likely Americans would go for something like UBI, because it would be \"fair,\" according to the American ethos, and that might provide some of the flexibility, optimism, and stress reduction that many people in the US are lacking, but even then I'm not so sure. It just seems like the most viable path to some gains, not a sure one towards these specific goals.","Make a the peace corps easier to join","It was designed for difficult unskilled labor for mostly remote rural projects, and the pay would be low. Family men would need additional living arrangements.  Plus it was the midst of the Great Depression. The govt hoped to keep unemployed teens and 20somethings out of trouble.","Philosophy starting from belief is always suspect to me.\n\nLike, it\u2019s one thing to believe in natural law from a premise of \u201cnature exists as it does because actions and objects have purposes conducive to its continuations.\u201d  IE we enjoy sex because sex is necessary for procreation.\n\nIt\u2019s another thing to think there is divine planning of it all, and punishment for non-adherence.  Nature has sets of inputs and expected outputs, and humans are as of yet the most clever natural beings to exist.  That we can create tools and methods to enjoy natural joy without natural consequences is our nature.\n\nAlso, they really first lost me when it came to *substance theory* and also when I discovered the difference between virtue ethics and other schools.","Market forces collided with marxist dialectics and flattened all human interactions into zero sum games.","yep lol capitalism assimilates anything and everything into a product for consumption. the only thing capitalism can\u2019t assimilate is class-based solidarity","Baudrillard- Societies of Control","\u2018our own desire to do what we feel like always\u2019 - one could argue this is the basis of civilisation and all human action.",">I guess the blanket assumption is that antinatalists are counted among the far left but I do think it lends itself well to right wing ideologies. Lest we forget that Nietzsche was an arch-reactionary and Schopenhauer held views we\u2019d consider deeply reactionary as well.\n\n>I think once you get passed the natural obstacle of natalism other taboo (and painful) truths become much more palatable and easier to swallow.\n\n>Side note: I get that the left-right distinction is meaningless and subject to ten million contradictions but it can be a useful shorthand\n\nlol this guy is retarded","No barriers to entry and its consequences","I did 1.5 years in my state\u2019s conservation corps. It helped me learned all kinds of new skills and explore the outdoors. I highly recommend it for any young adult who needs guidance.","Like the other commenter said, read about wage slavery. I would recommend Marx's [Wage Labour and Capital](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/wage-labour/index.htm) as a good starting point. It's short, and usually paired with another short essay called [Value, Price, and Profit](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1865/value-price-profit/ch01.htm#c0) (which you should read too!).","Unless you want to build a society where no one has to work for food or shelter, all labor will be coerced to an extent. The idea that in a socialist utopia that people would come together and do work purely for the public good isn't borne out by any historical evidence.","the problem is, in Europe especially, having functioning bureaucracy and infrastructure is correlated against having any kind of redeeming cultural features.","The king/sovereign always picked winners in the past via \"mercantilism\".  American Colonialism flipped the script in 1776 by removing the king and making it possible for large companies to choose our politicians via lobbying aka Corporatism.  True Capitalism (voluntary human interactions) never goes away, but continues to be \"illegal\" from Mercantilism to modern Corporatism.  Capitalism continues to get blamed and maligned for all the collective horrors and systemic flaws of Corporatism, while it continues to be regulated away from the the public and forced to only exist in the form of the \"black market\".","You really think that capitalism means nothing more than \"voluntary human interactions\"? That's so vague it's meaningless.","I've found similar kinds of take, in fact, from people identifying as leftists and as conservatives. The better kind of conservative idea about the family - the importance of those relationships and of community - leads inevitably to a broadly leftist economics, because capitalism always disrupts those relationships unless restrained. I guess that the role of the religious right has been to capture those tendencies, so that Republicans who want family life and community life get tricked into voting for an economy which makes them impossible. So as you say, the solution for the left is the one Zizek suggests","There's a distinction between religious right as the millions who are influenced by it, and the religious right as the small group of individuals and organisations who fund the politicians and come up with the policies. I'm saying that the average religion right republican has a genuine desire for family and community life which gets misdirected, by these pressure groups and lobbyists and such who lead the religious right, into support for neoliberal economics","I mean, under the conditions of capitalism. Although being able to reach family under those conditions would change the conditions, so then we're trying to imagine the post-capitalist family - it's *through and out*. I'm basically trying to think about this in terms of Mark Fisher's *Post-Capitalist Desire*, although I'm sure he'd reach very different conclusions about the family to me","> This meshes poorly with plenty of genetic and archaeological evidence that has been unearthed since then.\n\nI agree, marx and engels had imperfect historical information on past empires and production. Nevertheless it does not nullify their analysis on capitalist relations of which that had more than enough information on.","> Capital first found a workforce of mainly men, but as capital developed and grew, its need for a labour pool grew as well\n\nI'm not convinced the women's and civil rights movement won in the last century in the way we imagine it. From a capitalist point of view it makes total sense not to waste half the labour pool, the labour of different ethnicities or to import labour when needed. You obviously also wouldn't want your worker bees fighting each other based on gender, religious, or ethnic lines: that hurts productivity. There were huge political and economic aspects of both the feminist and civil rights movement that hit a brick wall and are now largely forgotten. The aspects that were \"won\" were granted because a new elite took over","Whaler Socialism","Meh its one of those things most people are probably against but not enough to affect voting habits and all the money is for it which does affect elections.","Who cares what we name the oppressive system they implement \u2026 It\u2019s gonna fuck us whether we choose to call it communism or not. It\u2019s irrelevant. \n\nYou are getting stuck in the sand of semantics and should really let it go so you can think more critically of things without such strong attachments to words that really have no solid meaning or connection to what they are representing any more.","there is no such thing as \u2018small business free market capitalism\u2019. an open market inevitably leads to small firms being outcompeted by larger firms.","They injected huge sums of government money into the economy during covid and, because capitalism is a system that filters money upwards, their failure to reclaim/redistribute it via taxes has resulted in the rich getting richer.","What you are describing is cronyism - America at the moment is just a collusion between Big Business(Money) and Big Government (Muscle).  If you aren't a member of those 2 cartels you are a bug to be squashed.","Theoretically yes, but do you think that's the case now? Which country do you live in that the \"left\" actually advocates for those sorts of policies? It's mostly cultural politics nowadays and the base of the contemporary \"left\" is often urban middle classes rather than the proletariat of the old. The political landscape is very different from 150 or even 50 years ago.","In this particular case, it's really just about it being the end of the great recession up until COVID hit.","Capitalism",],

I disagree about your fucking retarded idea to \u201cseize churches.\u201d :D","The fact that black people are protestant is so bizarre to me.","It\u2019s because the Catholic Church refused to ordain black clergy for a disgustingly long time.

Swap out those terms for Bible verses and you got an evangelical","yeah this is bullshit plenty of lifelong catholics are insane too","Are there American Catholics?\n\nEdit: I meant they","Yeah I hate the newfangled tradcaths who get really into Catholicism like Mother Theresa and St Augustine and Jesus Christ. They don't know what it's really about","I can always smell out an adult convert who\u2019s never heard a small town parish choir try to \u201csing\u201d a Latin hymn. Careful what you wish for, babe.","Yeah as a practicing cradle Catholic, the converts can be more extreme/annoying, but its also pretty annoying to see lapsed/non-believing cradle catholics try to gatekeep or tell other folks what \u201creal\u201d catholicism is when they never paid attention to any of the teaching growing up and haven\u2019t been inside a church since high school.","I was raised and educated Catholic and now go to a Catholic University and I can say with absolute confidence that no one gives a shit about anything Catholic. I'm only Catholic because I cannot imagine being anything else, bit also Jesuits are kind of cool I guess. It's weird how my lack of interest into my religion lead me to read more about it and I kind of appreciate a bit more","The people who I know who are Catholic are very chill. Pro abortion rights pro gay marriage, etc. if I had to choose between hanging out with a Catholic and hanging out with someone Baptist or whatever else I\u2019d choose the Catholic any day just based on my experience","I don't respect trads, but they're more intellectually honest about the religion. If the faith is true and unchanging, and the Church is of God, all that wild shit previous popes and saints wrote still applies. The host is literally Jesus, confess every sin to your priest, no meat on Fridays or work on Sundays, mass every day of obligation, no contraception, no divorce, no cohabitation before marriage, no busting anywhere except your wife's pussy.\n\nYou can't just throw all that out and keep just the cool parts of church (community, pipe organs, steaming shame-fueled sex with guys) and pretend it's the same religion.","Same, I imagine for most born-catholics and casual catholics all this tradcath shit by converts looks like cringe larping like it is for me. Hell even my grandma would be disgusted with those freaks","Most converts are just doing it to please their irish or latino spouse","Yeah they were pretty cool for a while, when the libs were trying to nail them for pedophilia, but based Rome refused to do anything but move their pedophiles into regions where they could get away with it easier.\n\nThe autistic Catholicism really steals that thunder, don\u2019t they realize they\u2019re robbing Peter to pay Paul?","Mostly same. I grew up going to mexican churches in south texas and only a couple crazy old ladies would ever even talk about it. There are a lot of accepted \u201chypocrisies\u201d that no one really cares about diving into \u2026 much less like actual liturgy. Most people who go to mass believe in a God, yeah, but they go because it\u2019s just what you do on Sunday mornings, which is fine. My mom goes because she likes to sing in the choir and get tacos after with her friends. \n\nI feel like when people on here use their fivethirtyeight poll maps tier analysis to talk about this trump loving ultra conservative Mexicans \u2018phenomenon\u2019 theyre confusing mellow, poor to middle class Catholic ones with the more recent, upwardly mobile evangelical convert types who wish they were white. And yeah the mellow ones can be racist and sexist in a shit talky way but no one here really associates that with any sort of political conservatism.","The organization is designed to prioritize the pinnacle of the hierarchy.\n\nCatholic liberation theology is probably catholicism's greatest expression in the modern world, but I don't think you can really separate the good guys in the wehrmacht from the institution as a whole.","\u2018Is this a American thing\u2019 the well know American institution called the Catholic Church\n\nWhy do liberal Europeans like to pretend only Americans are Christian\u2019s?

The phrase is in pretty common use in the UK\n\nAfaik this originates from Anglo-American Evangelicalism, so I guess so, I do not remember the last time that I saw that phrase be used in a language other than English.","I don't need to fucking qualify my families catholic credentials to you lol, they do do the majority of that shit but not all of it, they don't all go to mass read in Latin (some do, the ones actually in the church). \n\nEssentially is it pre Vatican II Catholicism then? \n\n> Conservative boomer JP2 loving Catholics you seem to be thinking of are not tradcaths\n\nI was *asking* if that's what 'tradcaths' are. Because the reality is that 'tradcath' isn't a term used outside of your little retarded internet podcast life. Real catholics don't know wtf a tradcath is.\n\nAlso why not just answer my initial question instead of being a little snippy bitch at every turn?","All clergy is trained in theology insofar as their seminary trains them; they have to understand doctrine, which is only one part of theology. Catholic theology, commonly called, can be separated into basically 3 different sections; ecclesial, doctrinal, and philosophical explorations. \n\nPhilosophical explorations is by far the most extensive field, and it\u2019s what \u201ctheology\u201d usually refers to in a non-lay sense. A lot of people call all three things \u201ctheology\u201d, but typically ecclesiology and doctrinal study aren\u2019t considered \u201ctheological exploration,\u201d which is why I put theology in quotes. The average priest doesn\u2019t study a lot of ecclesial theology beyond the basic ecclesial structure; advanced study is left up to specific professions and callings, Canon Lawyers being an example. Doctrinal theology is the most extensive field explored in seminary in the administration of priestly duties; to guide the faithful away from errors in profession, especially. \n\nPhilosophical exploration is not deeply explored in a lot of Seminaries, and many priests don\u2019t have a deep interest or knowledge on it because it\u2019s obscure, and doesn\u2019t have such an evident purpose/utility as the rest. Many priests could tell you a basic overview of the differences between Thomistic/Aristotelian philosophy and Augustinian/Platonic, but even these are fairly obscure, and most old priests I know have long since forgotten or stopped caring. \n\nPhilosophical exploration was a lot more common in the Early Church because doctrines had not been clearly established as the singular teaching of the magisterium in many cases; you talk about fights over specific words, a good example would be at the first council of Nicaea, where the philosophy of homoousios and homoiousios was debated. But this isn\u2019t common today, because many subjects that require philosophical debate (especially ontology) are settled, and modern debates are usually about whether the Church teaches a certain thing or not. \n\nPriests have to have some philosophical theology, at least relating to basic catechesis about things like Christology (Nicaea debate for instance) or conception of the Trinity. However a lot of it beyond this is uncommon and often times obscure, even in formal theological education. Teleology and philosophical morality will be studied fairly in depth. There will be light coverage of the conception of man and the ontology of the soul, things like that. Examination of Christian conceptions of \u201cexistence\u201d for example, which that guy mentioned, are very light, because the topic as a whole is vaguely defined. There\u2019s quotes everyone knows like \u201cOur hearts are restless until they rest in God\u201d but not a whole lot more. \n\nTrying to conceive of or explain \u201cexistence\u201d as a whole is typically done in a scientific manner, or in a highly mystical manner, by those in religious life and contemplation. The mystical form intersects with theology but it\u2019s very vague and ill-defined, that\u2019s why there\u2019s so few \u201ctheologians\u201d today; John Paul II\u2019s papacy was considered very theology-heavy, but it really wasn\u2019t compared to Benedict. Congar, Rahner, Balthasar, are all examples of modern day theologians who were significant or \u201cbroke ground\u201d or dealt with \u201cheavy questions.\u201d Very few priests could tell you much about their writings, and even I\u2019d struggle to do so because they mesh together and they\u2019re indistinct compared to the early Church. If you\u2019re asking an average clergy member about questions of \u201cexistence\u201d, they will have very little \u201ctheology\u201d to give you about it, and even the people who\u2019ve studied that kind of theology extensively won\u2019t have a ton of concrete stuff to give you. If you want to \u201creally drill down\u201d into issues like THOSE, you have to read a lot more than most people can provide you in explanations. \n\nIf I\u2019m speaking in obscure terms and using pretentious retarded language somewhere tell me, I\u2019m not trying to use the biggest words possible to shut you down like Liz (rightfully) did to Dasha, it\u2019s just a really nuanced set of terms\n\nEdit: added spacing to make it more clear since I textwalled you. If you don\u2019t want to read it all my main point is in the first 3 and last 2 paragraphs","My buddy, here's something that is pretty obvious to me but you're kinda not aware of it at all. In Spain, Italy, Greece and Cyprus every kid is taught theology for all of the 12 years of compulsory state education. Everything that you wrote there and think are a nuanced set of terms are hardly middle school, Sunday school level stuff. Bruining didn't forcibly shut down anyone, she mentioned the most basic church history as a test of stupidity. You seriously thought Pelagianism is obscure? It looks like almost everyone here is or was Evangelical and just assumes things are similar.\n\nTo be a bit more clear on why that's obvious, I don't see anyone here even mention apostolic succession (because proddies reject it and you don't care in practice) but the orthocath base everything on it. Nobody mentions patrology, hagiography, church history and other completely boring shit that you can easily mention, that are all capital T theology, instead you pretty much describe proddy priests. For you, some ancient bishop of Antioch or Rome is history. For the orthocath bishops of any new seat he founded, he is their predecessor which gives them legitimacy and also legitimizes all their works unless they lose it. This means that church tradition is an extension of the new testament and contains disputes, propaganda, apologetics, a ton of new prophesies, and the writings of saints (inspired by the holy spirit) etc that are used as dogma. You don't go beyond that. Ever. So I really don't know where you get these explorations you're talking about. Questions of existence are going to be answered by referring back to church tradition, it won't be aimless thought. And yes priests are trained in that, the upper clergy almost always have theology degrees. Are they supposedly hard to get? Theologians are rare? In America? Degrees in theology are usually a prerequisite to ordination.\n\nThis is super boring to anyone who had to deal with it but the hilarious example isn't the ancient heresies about the rainbow nature of Jesus but the great schism of the churches itself which was about filioque and omg unleavened bread in the Eucharist. The reason both sides call each other schismatic heretics and constantly write about it. Yeah it really seems to me that Christian bitching (cath vs orth) over ecumenism and other stupid issues debated right now are a thing I don't want to hear but can't escape, yet you somehow haven't noticed debate happening over words yet. Stop trying to make people think that most modern tradcath theology is quantum physics and not essays on why social media and a life away from the church is satanic and stuff like that.\n\nCan you please just tell me where's this place that has these catholic or orthodox priests that you know that they'll just go \"sorry kid I don't know enough theology to answer that so best go talk to the laity without fear\"?","No. You think all catholics in Europe oppose the abortion ruling that exists nearly everywhere?","that's great, but most polish people are catholic and also racist and often act on it.","Yep, ~20% of Americans are Catholic, including, currently very relevant, the majority of the Supreme Court! The Catholic Church has a huge amount of political power here and essentially created the prolife movement as it exists today. I can say from experience that current-day American Catholic ideology (like some other Christian sects) includes the idea that its members are being persecuted (by not being allowed to force other people to adhere to Catholic values), and I think this reflects that a lot of people cling to its history for clout or rhetorical purposes.","opus dei freaks run this country now. every god-fearing american from the country\u2019s founding would detest our descent into popery","Everyone is always blaming the Puritans for anything wrong with American society, but I'll tell you this much, modern day Congregationalists and Unitarians are a million times better than these God damn Vatican agents working for the Whore of Babylon","Protestant culture is dominant, and therefore it\u2019s much harder for individuals to identify the extent that they are culturally Protestant.","We prefer the term \"Protestant Ascendancy\"","It\u2019s because protestantism isn\u2019t a real religion","Love the crucifix in the background. He's clearly a Mullen tradcath","Half the people from my Sunday school class are generic yuppie liberals and the other half are insane racists and homophobes with several felonies. \n\nAll these tradcath cosplayers who go on and on about Catholic law and council history would get scoffed at by the first group and violently assaulted by the second.","The Jesuit order has no monks, they\u2019re all priests more or less. They\u2019re typically pretty cool tho. The stereotype, which I\u2019ve found to be pretty true, is that many of them where rakes, alcoholics, gambling addicts, etc. before joining the order so they tend to have good stories.","aren't we still there? instead of religious beliefs it's \"not being a chud\" and the massively powerful institutions are Twitter et. al?","I can confirm, I was born catholic in Latin America, went to an Opus Dei highschool and I find all converts to be anoying","A lot of this doomerism is just secular eschatology. It attracts the same neurotic personality type that would always talk about the rapture if they were raised religious.","dont accuse me of preaching trad ways","needs more catholic stuff to be complete","I was raised Catholic. I strayed from the flock. At twenty seven years of age, I returned to the one truth faith.\n\nI can assure you that I do have an intense personal connection to Jesus Christ.","The entire premise of Catholicism is the church must mediate your relationship to god.\n\nProtestants have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. Catholics have to go talk to the priest.","Sexual orientation is Catholic","Unitarians?","tradcath","Just say deconstruction of church.","Are you doing a bit right now? Like a time travelling poster thing? America hasn't really had much popular Christianity in the culture outside the south since the Bush years, and you're talking about the Muslim world like those aren't the countries where you can get beheaded for premarital sex.",],

But then he took me to meet his friends, and the guy acted so submissive towards his best friend (who was fat and had bitch tits) that I made up a reason to leave and then ghosted him. Like he would laugh at every joke the fat one said, he'd quiet down as soon as fatty started talking, and acted like a freshmen boy trying to get the cool senior to like him. Sometimes I regret not telling him to stop acting like this loser's bottom, but I figured that it may be best for the species as a whole if he continued to turn women off and not spread his weak bitch seed.","That handshake was ripe with sexual tension","this reminds me of when i worked at a grocery redistribution warehouse and i was noticing some discreet dude from grindr was literally stalking me at work. like, thinking it\u2019s a fun game of \u201ccome and find me!\u201d i had never met him in person and if i had only spoke once and never introduced. he must\u2019ve waited for me out of a sea of hundreds of employees because one day he literally took a picture of my car while i was walking out on break and texted \u201cyou got a cute car\u201d on grindr. never felt more violated lmao","I told my GF who taught elementary school kids at the time and her response was \"she was right he is a pussy\"","A guy once said \u201cgive me ur number or we never talk again\u201d. I said ok and left.","I didn\u2019t make him fat! Not a self created thing! I\u2019ll never experience anything like that again I\u2019ll tell you that much and I didn\u2019t pay any rent the whole time, so a net neutral/ terrible learning experience but I\u2019ve had plenty of massive dong to my heart\u2019s desire since","I had the same experience trying to find the clip of Nick Fuentes saying that having sex was gay. It freaked me out how thoroughly it'd been scrubbed.","Dam this is just like when my 7th grade girlfriend Danny grinded jon\u2019s dick at Amanda\u2019s house party (I heard from a friend who was there. Amanda stole her moms rum and Malibu and I guess it got pretty messy). I didn\u2019t go cuz I had food poisoning.

I asked him to leave though as I hadn\u2019t thought of what I could get out of it.","Lmao this guy is such a fucking mess. I had a weird rare opportunity to hang out and drink with a musician that I used to really like the other night, and she showed me some DMs from this dude that were similar (including the bizarre and seemingly non-sequitur use of the word \"faggot\" which is very funny cause now I think that's his move lol). You almost wanna laugh but she did pretty earnestly tell me that as a young person who looked up to the guy, it was very disheartening to receive that from him, and like, I get it. Dude's clearly a fuckup.","I was in a bar with my boyfriend and a childhood buddy he has not met in like a decade called him so they had a long conversation on the phone. When he left to use the restroom the lady next to me told me he was so full of red flags (bc he was on the phone) and I should leave him. Her boyfriend was so apologetic to me and told her to mind her business. Unsolicited advice is wild","had a dream we were in high school & dating. she was crying & telling me about how bad she felt from sleeping with 2 guys despite me having the irl knowledge of her actual body count. i pretended to be accepting & barely said anything. there were broken windows in her house & i measured them for fixing","I dated a pretty one and by chance right before I was going to tell my brother he referenced [this family guy joke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OR_D2EEPS4) then when I showed him a picture of her he was just like 'oh she's just in woman world then, I guess she can't do anything'","Last night I had a dream where I went to meet my girlfriend\u2019s parents and her mom was Lena Dunham and her dad was a deformed and giant version of Bob Odenkirk. They were both bedridden so I had to awkwardly shake their hands as they were lying down and naked, it was really creepy.",">The phrase was coined by the fictional character Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris) in \"Not a Father's Day\", an episode of the television series How I Met Your Mother, first aired in November 2008. Barney points out to his friends a group of women that initially seem attractive, but who are all unattractive when examined individually. This point is made again by two other characters, Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor) and Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders), later in the episode, who note that some of Barney's friends also only seem attractive in a group.[3]","\u201cMeh\u2026 I think it\u2019s back to grindr for me\u201d","I\u2019ll give you the text I got recently.\n\n\u201cHey I had a lot of fun last night but I just wanted to let you know I don\u2019t really see this going anywhere. Just wanted to let you know where I stand.\u201d\n\nWham bam thank you ma\u2019am and that\u2019s all you need. \ud83d\ude14","I haven't been cancelled for things I've said in the past. Mostly things I say in the present, and the only non-social consequences have been losing my student job in high school.","i've been cancelled online multiple times but it was all so inconsequential in the long run","Years ago a girl i knew called me up to buy some coke. I went to her house. We didn\u2019t know each other that well but had always gotten along well, had known each other socially for a few years. She was already drunk when I showed up and she started giving me drinks. I had nothing else to do that night so I figured why not stay and hang. We did some lines and watched YouTube videos of some psych rock band we were both into. A few hours of this sort of stuff.  Her boyfriend (who I knew) was out of town but it was all very innocent. Then she disappeared, I thought she was going to the bathroom. She comes out of her bedroom wearing lingerie and jumps on top of me. At this point in my life I was pining for this other girl who had dumped me out of the blue, I was hopelessly love sick and not attracted to this girl at all. I admit that I can see how she got the wrong idea from my behavior here, I should have not have accepted so many drinks from her. I don\u2019t really care what anyone says a straight man and a straight woman really can\u2019t get too fucked up alone together. Anyway I said no and she blew a gasket, literally screaming at me, calling me a faggot. I passed out on her couch.  I left the next morning and a few weeks later moved across the country.  \n\n\nMonths go by and suddenly friends of mine from that city start ignoring my calls and ghosting me. Years later I was passing through and visited my best friend there. She told me that the girl had told everyone I raped her that night. She told me she didn\u2019t believe the girl but that most people did and that she had spinned me moving away into some sort of indication of guilt\n\nAnyway that\u2019s the story of how I got \u201ccancelled\u201d it hasn\u2019t affected my life much but my band can\u2019t play shows in that city which is fine because it\u2019s a mediocre place anyway.",],

text: ["more like big tech in collaboration with the CIA keep anyone from getting too based w a woke social credit system","How is this \"AI model\" any different from a google image search?","It's absolutely real and can do all the things shown in the video. I'm a datascientist so I work with Machine Learning and AI on once in a while and its even more impressive for me because the scale of such a model is just unimaginable to anyone but corporations with millions of dollars to spend on a piece of tech like this.","These people look like AI generated celebrities that look familiar but don't actually exist.","Even fucking forums are being filled with AI. It's so blatantly obvious that political subjects are entirely hijacked by special interests running GPT-like bots to try and manufacture consent. We know as a matter of fact the CIA and NSA both do this, but you'd have to be an idiot to think there aren't literally hundreds of special interests wanting to \"control the internet narrative\" on whatever the topic is.\n\nOriginally I thought the internet was causing people to get worse and worse - which it is - causing all these spaces to become more insufferable and impossible to talk with. Then I did some research into CIA tactics for manufacturing consent and the widely available Chinese tactics on how they've been doing it online since 2012 with huge success... And you start to realize, that these political spaces are behaving in ways that are perfectly in line with these tactics. It became super obvious that all these comments where deploying the exact sort of tactics CIA and China use to push agendas. \n\nFor those wondering, the easiest way to manufacture consent online isn't by direct \"debate\" or discussion, but rather, disrupt and derail people talking on topics you don't want them talking about. Don't try to \"win\" the argument, just make the entire space so insufferable for anyone trying to share an unapproved thought, that the people decide to stop participating and sharing the idea because it's so unpleasant of an experience. People will then self sensor and stop talking about it. The tactics are usually revolving around derailing the conversations using any fallacious technique you can think of. The goal for the bots isn't to spread counter information, but to stop organic information from appearing to begin with by pushing those people out.\n\nAt the end of the day, you're left with bots, and useful idiots dominating the spaces, with all the rest of the normal people unable to participate anywhere because it just triggers the attacks. This, in turn, creates a sense of false consensus and thus, manufactured consent.\n\nAlso: I've personally used GPT - it took me 4 hours to code (I haven't coded in years, so that 4 hours was way longer than it should be) a program that would monitor a subreddit, and automatically engage users on a topic, using a GPT model of my choosing, to hold an opinion that I chose. I did hundreds of posts before I ran out of tokens. If my dumbass can do it, sophisticated, funded, interested, parties are definitely doing it.","It's more that the music industry has better lawyers and protections for using copyrighted material and taking credit for them as originals than gigantic banks of publicly available images do.\n\nThe AI data pools that are drawing on images can pretty much use other people's work with impunity, whereas the ones drawing on music can very quickly get into to legal hot water for using countless hours of copyrighted music, so other people's work (that would prob legally require royalties to even use here for each and every one), to generate even just one track.\n\nThat's why we're not hearing much about them, whereas AI art is the trendy headline of the day, but honestly, AI generated art often has some creepy details that give me some kind of trypophobia vibes - I do know how to describe it, but it's literally often gross to look at for me.","I don't think that the better ability of AI to simulate reality is going to cause many problems, I'm going to guess that we'll find a method either to sign genuin material or to recognize if something was made by an AI.","Have you considered MAiD?","AI","Mhm, OpenAI is an opinionated organization. Even if it weren't, it's impossible for an AI to be unbiased, because they're still made by humans and trained on human works. So countering the inherent biases requires active work against the bias, which is itself biased, and so on, and so on...even if it could be perfectly \"neutral\", deciding what counts as neutral involves bias too.","That article was definitely written by a bot and just runs other online calculators for its numbers lmao. Just admit you didn\u2019t know what you were arguing about and move on.","Their articles already look like ai generated","I mean if they give you a cookie cutter assignment. Evidence, elab, etc, repeat. Maybe I\u2019m totally wrong, but I figure a ai can\u2019t follow such constraints well.","I'm gonna train an AI model on this guy","Yes.  You can also use AI to augment existing images.","I think the AI could do a better job","AI generated coliseum. Absolutely despicable.","clearly AI hasn\u2019t gotten typesetting down","Millions will die from wars and mass shootings started by over text-to-speech AI.","Not if law dictates that every AI tool must encode data inside of all content it generates indicating that it's AI generated\n\nwhich is why we need lawmakers that know what the internet is",],

Orcs are pure evil with no redeeming features.","Sauron was right about this, in the end Frodo decides he wants to keep the ring","Sauron discovers Frodo is in Mt Doom only when he chose to wear the ring. Even at that point he was still 100% correct, the only reason the ring got destroyed is because Gollum lost balance and fell into the lava (and here a common theory is that the breeze that pushed him over was literally sent from God, which means that only Divine Providence could resist to the charm of the ring)","I don\u2019t think Lord of the Rings was made for children, though. Too difficult. Made for & primarily enjoyed by weird nerdy adults. Some teenagers, sure, but not like young children unless they\u2019re very precocious.","LOTR also has historical context and a single author both of which star wars/marvel are lacking. They'll have historical context eventually but that takes time and they're never going to be as deep as LOTR.","To what extent does that exist in the text, rather than in the moral implications we presuppose on a world that *should* function like our own?\n\nWhile the text says the orcs are \"corrupted\" and such, it places no victimhood or any level of sympathy towards them.  They're treated as moral actors who made the choice to be \"evil.\"","LOTR basically invented an entire new genre of fiction, has some brilliant writing and has quite a lot of subtext - easily worth discussing in a college level lit class. The scouring of the shire, Tom bombadil, etc. Star Wars and Marvel are based on how explosions and muscles are cool and are written by focus groups to extract the most money","I agree Tolkien was a far better and far more consistent world builder and writer.  \n\nI am only stating that the text of LOTR, or as far as I know other texts, doesn't back up the idea that orcs are anything other than ontologically \"evil\" actors.","Yes, correct. The Hobbit was, Lord of the Rings wasn\u2019t.","LOTR is great but otherwise yeah","It's possible for it to be both simplistic in that specific way while also exploring nuanced themes.","He\u2019s right but I wince every time people put Lord of the Rings in the same category as pop culture Disney slop.","The complexity comes more from comparing Sam and Aragorn not comparing Aragorn and orc #435.  LOTR is  unusual (and more complex than Star Wars) because there isn't a power fantasy.  The protagonists aren't a powerful wizard or mighty elf, it's two humble hobbits.  The childish version of LOTR is in Shadows of Mordor, a video game where you level up until you become powerful enough to stab sauron in the head.  Frodo's biggest foe isn't an orc, it's his own desire for the ring's power.","LoTR is sooooo morally simplistic. Very easy to immediately recognize who is \u201cgood\u201d and what is \u201cevil\u201d and that ebbing and flowing with good people and greed. Works of art that are NOT morally simplistic are way more confusing. They have you identifying with people who do bad things. Or bad people. Or questioning whether certain acts or thoughts are actually good or bad. Or being annoyed by \u201cgood\u201d people and have you question what is good, bad, right, or wrong. There\u2019s no questioning any of that when there is an evil eye of sauron and a ring of greed and pure hobbits and friendship and evil orcs. That describes a very passive moral experience.  \n\nThe recent popular novel \u201cMy Year of Rest and Relaxation\u201d is an example of a work that is not morally simplistic. Harder to define. Works that are not morally simplistic are Uncomfortable and unsettling to people with simplistic moral worldviews. Nobody older than 6 is uncomfortable or upset by Lord of the Rings.","Twin peaks has ideas of real evil forces but has a lot more ambiguity as to how those forces manifest in people who carry potential for both.  I don't think it's that comparable although I do tbink it is sincerely moral art , which is fine and is not the main problem with capeshit","LOTR is probably the most celebrated work of fiction from the past few centuries. Who the fuck is this redditor to say we to restrict our appreciation of along on the lines of some pseudo scientific \"diet\", like it's a cheeseburger from their favorite fast food place.","I am utterly entranced with the idea of the country idyll, the unspoiled rural farm scape, all the things that Tolkien paid tribute to in his Shire.  But I know the country, and I know the people there, and it is often not very nice at all.","If he's into Lotr, you gotta tell him about the Third Age Mod for Medieval Total War 2 \ud83d\ude18","Ya or fantasy. Tolkien really loves to drag out describing some places tbh","Oh I don't necessarily think it is a negative, I get why he does it especially since obviously there weren't *movies* of his works back then and fantasy was an overall still new genre - I'm just saying fantasy is a good case where skipping parts isn't necessarily detrimental to understanding the overall story","This idea that \"OMG Tolkien is too verbose \ud83d\ude20\" sounds like a pretty popular arrbooks take to me.",],

text: ["Exactly. It's so weird seeing most educated Americans I know either pretend or genuinely believe that the presence of Caucasian admixture in African-Americans is primarily because of the US slaveowners' insatiable thirst for rape...\n\n...instead of, say, the 2+ centuries of local cohabitation common to the sexes of both racial groups.\n\nObviously sexual domination is always inherent to slavery, but the universal and utterly human truth is that even if you eliminated rape from US history the Caucasian admixture of African-Americans would decrease only marginally.\n\nI once read some old Orthodox Saint quip something along the lines of: \"It is more likely that a corpse should rise from the dead than men and women live alongside without intercourse.\" So it goes.\n\nI wonder how much this impression correlates with the general educated American tendency to treat slavery as some sort of *special* evil within history.","Oh Jesus, it's so Freaking retarded.  \nDude I know we fucked Africa, but open \"commercial exchanges between France and other countries\" and you'll see the ridiculous amount that Africa represents, just so you get a simple idea straight.   \n\n\nThe colonization costed more that it gave us money. We maintained it for geopolitical reasons.   \nAnd that thing with the Franc CFA is ridiculous. And I don't have the time to explain very basic concepts about this. I doesn't brings us money. And we pay the ressources at the price of the market.","at the film festival i sat through four fucking land acknowledgements before the movie even started playing. i thought it was a fuck up but it happened twice so maybe not","I think nobody wants to openly admit that the Indigenous people of North America got wiped out so hard that they are doomed to never truly recover from it. They'll never *actually* restore their sovereignty and status as independent nations on their own land, unless we decide to commit a full blown Canadian genocide and deport every white skinned cracker there back to Europe that is. \n\nThe \"best\" apology that states like Canada can offer now, which isn't giving all the land back by Crtl-Z'ing all Canadian expansion westwards since 1867, is performative apologies and financial compensation (which basically means still slowly assimilating the Aborginals into extinction anyways, by integrating them into the economic system and making them into generic wagies like the rest of us)","How do you think the Native groups got their land? Do you think the same groups who first inhabited a chunk of land just held it for over 10 thousands years? \n\nIts not awareness its just deluding yourself about how humanity and human history works.","I think you'd be surprised, I grew up on the west coast of bc and there are a good number of indigenous people around. I've lived near reserves my whole life. They make up about 5% of the population of British Columbia, which isn't a huge number but its more than double what you'd normally find in the states.","As a paddy, I don't want ulster unionists doing land acknowledgements and saying how sorry they are about ethnic cleansing and the plantation of Ireland. I want the six counties back. Obviously there's more of a mechanism there allowing for it to potentially actually happen someday, but every time I read about land acknowledgements in the us or Canada or Australia, I imagine the natives feel the same way.","me when i steal your car and give it to my kids and it makes no sense to give it back bc there's more of them than there are of you (you need to accept that my kids' ancestors were bad people but their sins are not our responsibility to undo)","Right of conquest is only legitimate when it\u2019s 2 groups of white people over 300 years ago.","Land acknowledgements are straight up reprehensible. Either give it back or don't, Jesus fucking Christ. Don't tell them it's their land and then live on it, even the colonialists weren't that evil. \n\nWe treat Indians like the existence of the US is an episode of While You Were Out. Damn shame it happened, no justification for it, clearly morally wrong on every level, but take a look at what we've done with the place and frankly God knows you weren't doing shit with it. Enjoy the beads and the civilization or bitch about it, not my problem, I got my own bitching to do.","I thought about doing a bit where, like in New England or the East Coast in general for example, doing land acknowledgments but instead being like \"We are on traditionally English land that rightfully belongs to the King\".","> land back is tenable and its not what most people think\n\nproceeds to not say anything about what land back would actually entail.","My husband is part Indigenous and from Vancouver. They frequently do land acknowledgements at film festivals there. One time, before a screening of a film, I jokingly bowed to him as they were doing an acknowledgement, then four other women thought I was being serious and proceeded to do the same to him.","When my grandmother was a child in Romania she said they just assumed every single English/American/German was basically infinitely wealthy and that every Russian raped women with the same frequency they ate meals. \n\nI think that thought was related when I started to type","What's your opinion on [Cleopatra being Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra_race_controversy)?  Did you encounter the theory much?  I dated a classicalist and she thought  that critics of the theory were probably racist.  I think that view is echoed by Donna Zuckerberg (yes, she's his sister) who seems like a respected classicist.  \n\n\nI always thought of it as a huge reach, but i'd buy that these [guys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Dynasty_of_Egypt) you mention were Black (or at least we'd call them that if they were alive today - social construct blah bla)","Call me libby but I thought Coates wrote well about [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20111227032227/https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2009/06/nathan-bedford-forrest-has-beautiful-eyes/19546/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I think, when you're in your intellectual infancy, myth keeps your sane. When I was young I believed, like a lot of us at that time, that my people had been kidnapped out of Africa by malicious racist whites. Said whites then turned and subjugated and colonized the cradle of all men. It was a comforting thought which placed me and mine at the center of a grand heroic odyssey. We were deposed kings and queens robbed of our rightful throne by acquisitive merchants of human flesh. By that measures we were not victims, but deposed nobles--in fact and in spirit.  \n>  \n>I don't propose that blacks are alone in our myth-making, or in our desire to ennoble ourselves. But given the power dynamics of this society, we're the ones who can afford the comforts of myth the least. This is doubly true for those of us who are curious about the broader world. By the time I came to Howard University, I was beginning the painful process of breaking away from the \"oppression as nobility\" formula. But the clincher was sitting in my Black Diaspora I class and learning that the theory of white kidnappers was not merely myth--but, on the whole, impossible because disease (Tse-Tse fly maybe?) kept most whites  from penetrating beyond the coasts until the 19th century.\n\n(It's obviously much more interesting than \"DOnt they know that Blacks sooold slavveess???\" or whatever pithy dunk is here)","It was foreign entities that made Warren's ancestors give up their land though",],

Not even people who follow her - just people who saw it on FYP or trending or wherever\n\nIf you told me that even just ten years ago I wouldn't have believed it","This is kind of random but the post reminded me of a youtube channel I can no longer find. I can't remember if it was actually a popular channel or just had a couple viral videos. But it was this woman who was extremely fat and wore like really, intentionally ugly makeup and clothes. She had a sort of comedy channel that was all about beauty standards or some dumb shit.  And then a few videos would be her mental breakdowns. She showed pictures of herself in college and she was actually slim and attractive, but had since put on weight. And instead of just losing weight she had adopted this entire personality around how she didn't care what other people thought.

Like yeah obviously just not eating meat is the only real moral choice here, but failing that\u2014which 90% of Americans do\u2014you should at least be capable of doing what he did.","\u201cRegerative agriculture\u201d is so impossibly far off from the current factory farming standard you might as well be talking about The fucking Shire.","Ask these \"le sustainable farming\" people how they feel about free-range dog farms and then suddenly killing animals becomes a moral issue.","I don\u2019t know, plant based in the east has always been pretty tasty.","yea, because the meat eaters who judge vegans but call their dogs \u201cfurbabies\u201d are def only NOT eating their dog due to it being an inefficient food source, not because of emotional dissonance or anything.  only purely intellectual per calorie calculations","Just b12. Or you can eat nutritional yeast. Then again there is also a lot of fortified stuff meat and non-meat eaters eat. It\u2019s not that serious.","This is the core problem of all vegan discourse - it usually involves someone telling someone else that they are somehow morally deficient, which can imply some degree of disrespect. It's hard to maintain cordiality at that point, things are taken personally, we exchange blows,","There\u2019s a utilitarian argument for hunting (on wildlife management grounds). \n\nPigs are very smart animals, killing a pig is far more morally complicated than killing a dog.","hey sorry in advance for all this text, I know it's uncalled for; unfortunately I am on stimulants. \n\nYeah ignorance is the wrong word. There is a difference between total ignorance and the certain kind of disconnect I mean to describe: the position where you are aware of the killings, but there is a system of obscuring and fragmenting mechanisms that prevent you from seeing the viscera and feeling any sense of urgency. I can essentially download chicken nuggets off my phone. Discrete packets of firm grey mush encased in golden shells, they don't resemble the animals or the violence that produced them.\n\nSince you brought up the German example, I think concentration camps can serve as an instructive example for how mechanisms for obscuring brutal acts are necessary for their propagation. Originally, mass killings were conducted via conventional means, with guns and so on. I'm aware that there were many reasons for the introduction of gas chambers - to scale up the killings, to extract labour in camps from executionees prior to their last moments. What I'd hone in on for the purpose of my analogy is their useful property of casting a veil over the viscera, obscuring the killings from both the general public and the executioners themselves. The early proof of concept for gas chambers was when exterminations were limited to the mentally disabled, and the act needed to proceed in secret because it was believed that the public wouldn't go along with it. Simultaneously, some argue that gas chambers were introduced in part because the \"manual\" killings were so dehumanizing, so brutal and horrific, that the executioners were traumatized - there's the famous anecdote of Himmler (?) witnessing such an event and vomiting. The public of course knew regardless of the mode, as did the executioners, but officials felt that some degree of obfuscation was necessary in order that the killings didn't weigh on their conscience.\n\nSimilarly, in our case the public knows, but there is a big difference between the vague, opaque, non-urgent awareness of the slaughter most can claim and the full complicity taken on when one assumes the role of executioner and enacts the violence with full clarity. The former is wrong and certainly morally bankrupt in the sense that it serves the continued propagation of brutal and senseless killings, the second is in my view worse, specifically at the level of the individual.\n\nMy point is that when the veil is lifted and you see firsthand what it is like - when you take away some animal's life - natural responses are trauma or dissociation. Ideally you would experience compassion and decide not to go through with it. The clear follow through is to reject the killings as wrong. However, I see so many comments in the meat threads here to the effect of \"I killed my first animal, but I was not wrong to do so for in that moment I braced with Earth's serene moral equilibrium\" and I think this is an empty justification of their compliance and ultimately a form of nihilism.","I\u2019m not misunderstanding what animal rights is lol. I\u2019ve been vegan/vegetarian for 17 years & don\u2019t believe that killing animals for pleasure is moral.  Its just my opinion that we will ultimately have the greatest impact on animal welfare by tricking people into slowly giving up meat until one day they realize they\u2019re barely eating any anymore. Some restaurant owner who has made being vegan their whole personality and telling people to fk off is making it worse.",">\they sorry in advance for all this text, I know it\u2019s uncalled for; unfortunately I am on stimulants. \n\nLol you\u2019re good. Yeah I agree with basically everything you\u2019ve written about how the moral weight of the act of killing is obfuscated by the industrial system. I just don\u2019t really agree that the attempt to extricate yourself from this system, even if only symbolically or momentarily, is the real indicator of a kind of nihilism. I think the real nihilism is in acquiescing quietly to a system that deals out death and suffering to your benefit, all while remaining incapable of living out yourself the actions that deliver real moral consequences on the world. It\u2019s an abdication of responsibility. Because, like we\u2019ve said, there\u2019s still a residual awareness of what you\u2019re participating in. \n\nI don\u2019t think that taking an animal\u2019s life is incommensurate with respecting that life or seeing value in it. There\u2019s also the fact of the circumstances surrounding the act itself. An animal that you raise and kill yourself likely has better quality of life than one raised on a factory farm and whose death you\u2019re indirectly responsible for by consuming it. I\u2019m not saying that the former is a moral choice by any means but I do think it\u2019s the more moral of two immoral choices that few people are going to choose to forego completely.","virgin \"don't make us look bad\"-vegan vs chad \"fuck off, bloodmouth\"-vegan","lol fuck off, most plants grown are used to feed animals, if u cared about plant lives u would stop eating meat.","Every day a vegan does/says something that makes me glad i started eating meat again","> this is true, average american diet is horrific and wasteful with the meat. how can a burger made of a cow cost 1.25? horrors\n\nBecause it's been optimized into mostly soy and fecal matter these days","The vegans with pets are using the meat market. Any vegan with a pet is a fraud","A moral opinion that animals are not worthy of moral consideration. \n\nIt sounds like your rationale is that animals do not comprehend moral arguments and therefore do not get moral consideration. For the record, babies do not understand moral arguments either.","I think it\u2019s also that in the \u2018first world\u2019 we have more access to alternatives if you\u2019re poor and the only option for a major source of your caloric intake is animals you don\u2019t really have a choice to be vegan",">Most of them have trouble relating to everything WITH that!\n\ni get the critique but theres not another animal on this planet that does it better! the fact that we fail to meet our own lofty standards is telling about how important social cohesion is for us, and thats why we are so successful","Yeah and if I ever need to eat meat to live I'm sure I will adapt to that. But right now, I don't!","youre thinking im defending factory farming? im saying eating meat isnt evil","Eating chicken is \"murder\" the same way having an abortion is \"murder\". It isn't. And the hyperbole doesn't help your cause.","I think the main issue I took with your comment was framing it as a consumptive issue. Someone who eats chicken nuggets from McDonalds every week but shows up to factory farms to picket and film the horrific abuses is doing more to combat animal cruelty than someone who is politically inactive but refrains from eating any chicken, because 10,000 people doing the former could actually change the situation, but 10,000 people doing the latter are a barely noticeable blip. Meat consumption in the US isn't so high because Americans just love meat so much they naturally demand more, it's because of agricultural laws and subsidies that make it cheap and widely available. If I wanted to reduce meat consumption I wouldn't proselytize personal vegetarianism, I would recommend agitating against the laws and subsidies that make it so cheap and available.\n\nFor example, a ballot measure in California passed requiring pork sold be from pigs whose mothers have a large enough pen to sit and turn around in. Given what a piece of shit country we live in [the Supreme Court is almost certainly going to strike it down](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/11/us/supreme-court-pigs-animal-cruelty.html), but it's a better effort than telling people to quit eating bacon.\n\nAlso, lmao\n\n>Edwin S. Kneedler, a lawyer for the federal government arguing in support of the pork producers, gave a candid answer to a question from Justice Kagan.\n\n>\u201cSuppose we imagine ourselves back into slavery days,\u201d she said. \u201cWould it have been impermissible for a state to have said we\u2019re not going to traffic in products that have been produced by slavery?\u201d\n\n>Mr. Kneedler responded that \u201cI think the logic of our position would say yes.\u201d","They'll make money off that too by billing your insurance for the assisted suicide, recycling your good organs, and grinding your remains into hamburger meat. All for \"sustainability\".","my take is that anyone who's not a vegetarian has no right at moralising about hunting or visibility of animal slaughter (idk how to phrase it?).                \n           \nit's supposed to be that you see and know the animal you eat, teaches you to respect the food it gives you.                \n        \nanyone who buys store meat and feigns any remote shock at things like this needs to put on their thinking hat!","I mean, this is true for all livestock.","You\u2019re just flat out wrong here. Go check out a 4H club in Iowa and watch those kids all but suck off their livestock. \n\nIt\u2019s perfectly possible to humanely care for animals and then eat them. Most animals consumed in America are not treated this way, we all know this, but it happens a lot more often than most city slickers will ever know. Calling it a joke just shows ignorance.","The concept of murder logically extends to other species.","Now I\u2019m the reverse because I\u2019m a vegetarian and who realizes that people may need to hunt to provide for themselves.","Not sure what your point is, no one was arguing that and no one tells the cheetah they shouldn\u2019t eat the gazelle because it wants to be alive, but it\u2019s awfully bold of you to assume I want to continue to be alive.","By that logic, we genocide mosquitos every day","I just don\u2019t care about animals except for those I\u2019ve formed a bond with, I\u2019m not going to bat an eye at how farm animals live or die",">Killing an animal that had a good life is actually arguably worse because you are ending a good life rather than one of suffering.\n\nThis is an irrelevant point considering we are the responsible for the aforementioned quality of life for these animals.\n\nWe should aim to improve their quality of life as much as possible.","Raising an animal and killing it yourself \ud83d\udc4d\n\nEating a pet \ud83d\udc4e","I would say that spending the money to ensure that the animal gets a good life vs spending the money on some other luxury good is extremely ethical.","there's nothing beaitiful about killing beings that don't want to die. Also crop rotation regenerates the soil fine spare me all the nature fallacy bullshit. Not to mention the deforestation required to grow feed. The implication that we need animal agriculture in order for plant agriculture to work is too dumb.\n\n>Just get rid of all domestic livestock?\n\nYes.","I dunno - most of my friends are into healthy eating and regenerative agriculture.","Discourses of an rs Vegetarian","one who can't appreciate the raw beauty & grace inherent in physical exertion is subhuman -- because physical exertion is the only empirical evidence we have we are alive, that we are human\n\nhonestly might even be less dignified than most animals",],

He convinced the police there to allow him and help him evacuate classrooms that they realized the shooter wasn't in. From my perspective the story/headline is not as bad as it seems.

Maybe some women are more naturally talented than others but I was with a woman who went from mid to great over half a decade (I was probably really bad at sex in her defense). I think it highly depends on the recipient\u2019s preferences too but age of the woman is probably a strong corollary/determining factor because the ones I received when I was younger felt mostly performative and were in a lead up to sex more than something primary.","This is exactly what my wife's boyfriend told her and she's since been much more interested in blowjobs","Yeah, I've busted from eating pussy before. There is pleasure in pleasing your partner.","100%. Circumcision is a massive part of the \"blowjobs are meh\" phenomenon, because we mostly hear about it/see it through social media, and most social media users are Americans.","Yeah people definitely underestimate the physical attribute part of it. Obviously enthusiasm and general understanding of a man's anatomy goes along way, but women can be seriously hampered by physical factors. I had an ex who had a really shallow jaw and she couldn't physically open her mouth wider than a certain point. So try as she might, a deep BJ just wasn't possible without causing her real pain.","hate how women try to drag us down into their weird world devoid of pleasure where they only do shit for some weird psychoanalytic reason from their childhood. bitch we like head because it feels good","You\u2019re probably partially correct, but as an uncut American, I feel like over 50% of the women I\u2019ve slept with have poor technique, sometimes so bad that I ended it early, but a solid ~30% of the girls I\u2019ve slept with here rock my world during oral.","The secret to giving a good bj is to let go of any shame or restraint. I like to imagine that I am an anaconda who's literally about to eat this guy.","First time I\u2019ve ever thought about how one\u2019s physical facial features can determine if a BJ is good or not","i don\u2019t care for sucking dick so i just go really hard and make him bust as quickly as possible to get it over with. men don\u2019t really like this. if i enjoyed sucking dick i would do it really badly so i could go for longer.","Her saying fapping is so wrong","Was the sex good?",],

Easy to see a scary percent increase when the starting point is insanely low.\n\nhttps://data.unicef.org/topic/nutrition/malnutrition/","I've got a friend who was obese before the pandemic who has gotten huge and lazy.  I've tried talking to him about it, but he's pretty onboard with the fat logic.  He knows it's unhealthy (at least he can admit that), but he just doesn't care, he gets pleasure out of eating all the fast food and sugary drinks he wants, and sees no reason why he should give that up, and he and his wife both make a lot of money, he just assumes that any health issues that come up he can deal with because he's got the money to pay for it.  Nobody is gonna talk him into changing his lifestyle, and any attempts to are a waste of time.  I feel really bad for the example he is setting for his daughter more than anything though.","You kid but now that I\u2019m an adult or whatever idk how to articulate to serious people around me that overweight black women are the only thing that can make me feel comfortable once needles are involved. I can get shots and whatnot they just make it 10x easier","They can have a weightwatchers subscription","I can tell his bmi is around 25","Rude! I\u2019m 28 and get ID\u2019d on the reg. \n\nI don\u2019t even know what HFCS is but apparently  US consumption of it is 65 times higher than UK (25kg per person every year in the US, 0.3kg in the U.K.). \n\nBut (as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll remind me) Brits pig out on other shit that leads to an overall ugliness","Taking a kid to weightwatchers or those other diet programs is pretty demoralizing tho. It's also not that hard to cut out junk and to promote healthy eating habits at home, given you have the income for it. Having your kids cook with you from a young age and appreciate food as something that is nutritious is also important. If they're that young, they can lose the weight with some minor lifestyle changes, and you don't have to resort to drugs or shoving them into a program with a bunch of 40 something year olds.","This article also mentions that the guide lines suggest severely obese people over 13 should be given bariatric surgeries idk how to feel about that","Obesity is a national public health crisis caused by zero regulation on additives in food, lack of education around health, lack of access to healthcare, and the fact that vast swathes of the country are effectively food deserts. Obesity is a risk factor in an insane amount of painful and dangerous diseases, and it is fucking DISGUSTING that CHILDREN are subject to it by people who are supposed to care for them. It is without a doubt child abuse, even if it\u2019s not legally recognized as such.","Don't shove so much sugar down their throat they have a BMI of 40","I fully agree with this kind of thing. I think letting your kids become overweight is just so morally wrong, I would never forgive myself as a parent and I think the parents involved should be shamed mercilessly. It sets your kids up for a lifetime of health and body image problems (fuck that body positivity shit, nobody wants to be obese, I never want my child to have to \"convince\" themself or others they're attractive like that).\n\n I was lucky to grow up in a house that had a very balanced approach to food which I now realise is not what a lot of people got. We did get takeaways but my parents got their mains and sides and we took a tiny plate and we're happy. We would have fizzy drinks as a treat when we were out but we never had them in the house. There would be maybe one packet of crisps and one packet of biscuits. So we were hardly puritans. I remember going to a girl in my class' house who was very overweight even at 6 and the family was very American (I'm from Europe but they were mad into Disneyland) and in her house they just had these enormous boxes full of every treat under the sun that was always full. I think a lot of people have that in their house and they don't realise how mental that is. It is not difficult not to make a child fat - they are small, hence they need small portions. They also don't have money so if they get access to such large quantities of food that they become fat - that's your fault.",">Fat Talk: Parenting in the Age of Diet Culture\n\nlmao when did she write this book, 1993 during the heroin chic trend?","I thought it was about how liberals want our kids to be fat and die or something. How am I supposed to be outraged about something you could solve by letting a kid play outside and not neglecting them by feeding them cheeseburgers for breakfast?","I buy into taking this shit seriously but bariatric surgery on a kid is fucked up"," I want my 5 minutes back after reading that dumb article.  In a 24 year old study of people on the other side of the world, people who dieted \u201cseverely\u201d [read eating disorder] were 18 times more likely to have an eating disorder.  No shit.  And she bashes weight loss programs and then says HAES is basically as successful as those programs that were supposedly no good.  How is it controversial to say that kids shouldn\u2019t be obese. Im sure she would agree that they shouldn\u2019t smoke or drink booze, and they don\u2019t even shorten one\u2019s life expectancy as much (I don\u2019t think).  It\u2019s all just a cope and a virtue signal, which would be fine if it wasn\u2019t at the expense of kids\u2019 health.","Don't forget the classic \"BMI doesn't mean anything\" even though this specifically refers to children with a BMI of 35+. I am genuinely curious what she thinks a child with a BMI of 35 would look like that's not obese. I don't even think professional body builders get into that range.",],

I am married.","What would you say to your wife if you saw a video of her like that?","I knew it as soon as he spoke. That's a pathetic man brought to his knees by this woman. He cares about her well being and has let her convince him that he's not enough for her for whatever reason (maybe he used to be a piece of shit? Who knows). Now he performs self flagellation in a dark room for his wife on command so she can film it and show it to the world. Evil, yet as the husband he's convinced himself it's the evil he deserves, and is going to stick with it because he's become a huge loser.\n\nMeanwhile of course the boyfriend is relaxed and laid back and fat. He's fucking some dude's hot wife and the husband is literally cooking dinner for him.\n\nThis could be fake, but either way it's rage bait and she's just ripping into that poor guy.\n\nI'm also surprised at the other people thinking the fat idiot on the couch is the husband. I guess it would play into the narrative that the wife typically only cheats because her husband has become a fat man who doesn't do chores lol.","Her husband gives off asexual redditor vibes.","Apparently that guy is the boyfriend which makes this relationship even stranger","he\u2019s married to an autistic woman who\u2019s obsessed with placenta and they have half a dozen kids crammed into a tiny shitty house with no running water where they take baths once a week and reuse the bath water",],

I love you water, I am so grateful I love water I love water I love water.","I think this has to do with being completely retarded as opposed to being American. I don\u2019t know anyone who would bring less than at least a half gallon of water per person on a hike during the summer","I remember the wild theory cops made early on that they were caught in a [toxic algae bloom and were poisoned by the water](https://coastalreview.org/2021/10/california-family-likely-died-from-heat-not-algal-bloom/), or [escaping gas from old gold mines that closed down.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-58288482)\n\nNot sure which way to die is worse tbh","in our situation, we hiked down the ridgeline to blazed gully springs twice only to find the springs had dried up completely, and we were probably 10 miles past the last stream we had filled up at. we camped that night without water. the next day, about 7 miles further along the ridgeline, we found marsh grass and used a trowel to dig through hard mud until it became soft enough to pass through a filter.","This happens all the time in the Sonoran desert and after awhile you stop caring because checking how hot it's going to be when YOU'RE GOING OUTSIDE ON A FUCKING HIKE SHOULD BE OBVIOUS.\n\nhttps://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-breaking/2016/06/21/missing-german-hiker-found-dead-tucson-weekend-heat-toll-rises-6/86215376/\n\nIt does sucks that it happened.","I made a similar mistake Labor Day week 2020. Went out to see a shipwreck on the beach. Had water and knew it would be hot but didn\u2019t realize the heat index with the humidity was 115\u00b0. It was a 1 mile walk in the sand to the wreck and 1 mile back. On the way back my face felt like it was stinging, I was as red as a fire truck, felt dizzy and weak and was close to fainting. Went down to the water but my heart rate was 220bpm and I started to panic. My husband was ahead of me, mom was next to me. I unlocked my phone and handed it to her and said \u201cmy heart rate is 220, I\u2019m seeing wavy spots in my vision, I\u2019m not sweating, we are at ramp 4. If I go down, make sure to tell this to the 911 operator and that I\u2019m likely having a heat stroke\u201d. My husband made it back to the car and drove it up to the sand line and I was able to get in with help. AC on full blast in a brand new car so it should\u2019ve worked great but the heat index was so high the car was not producing cool air and we were 45 minutes from the nearest hospital, urgent care or even fire and rescue dept. It was honestly terrifying. Everyone else was hot and tired but I was the only one that had such a severe reaction to the extreme heat and humidity.","I don't really go hiking in the wilderness, but like I regularly go on 5-mile walks/runs in 90-degree weather in my very hilly town and I don't even have a sip of water and I'm fine. I get 109 is a lot hotter, but something seems off.","Hate to say it, but this was just a massively retarded move. I regularly mountain bike and climb in the sierras and all around Californian in the summer. First, if it\u2019s even close to 70 degrees to start the day you have maybe 2-3 hours in the morning to do something outdoorsy. It\u2019ll pickup past 11 and be unbearable to be out. It\u2019s much better to go later after the peak temp. Second,  pack more water than you think you will use. It\u2019ll come in handy just to cool off. Third, plan routes with actual tree cover. The difference between an exposed bluff and even a little bit of shade is enough to comfortably rest and cool off. \n\nThis is a tragic story, but honestly a really stupid one. Exercise a modicum of good judgement when going outside. Also invest in a Garmin or other satellite phone. They\u2019re maybe $200 and can easily save your life.","It\u2019s less treacherous to own a mountain bike and go to Moab honestly or backcountry ski. The uptake is harder but the lack of crowds makes up for it","I was there in October, took one look at Angel's Landing and thought FUCK THAT. There are many great hikes in Zion if you drive the long way to the hidden back entrance.","Those crackpots would sure love it to be but no! They died of hyperthermia because they made idiotic choices.","Nothing\u2019s off (except for some really poor choices by the people involved). I\u2019m from the area and have done the same hike they died on (before this incident occurred) and after you veer off from the river the trail is incredibly exposed and steep. Absolutely no shade to rest in. This area of California is also exceptionally dry in the summer\u2014and 109 degrees is substantially hotter than 90 when we\u2019re talking about physical exertion and how it relates to bodily function.","Got trapped in a blizzard on the PA turnpike a few years ago, for some reason I had the foresight to bring a case of water bottles but nothing else. We managed to get off and find a motel but everything around it was closed, no vending machines. \n\nWe had to beg the guy running it to let us buy some of his food, had to subsist off one pb&j sandwich and a banana for 3 days before we could get out. Don't go anywhere without a little extra on me now.","they should have checked the hourly forecast. they didn\u2019t need to bring the baby, they were rich and had a nanny. they shouldn\u2019t have brought the dog in this heat. they should have worn hats. they should have packed more water, and each person should have carried water in case they needed to split up. lots of should ofs. What did husband say?","having grown up in utah, this story scares the shit out of me. everyone i know thinks they\u2019re hiking experts and this is not out of the realm of possibility for them","Take it from a truck driver: you don't need to get too far out of town in most areas to lose signal, depending on your carrier, and especially if it's mountainous","Half a gallon for 2.2 people + dog is inexcusable sorry. Even in the rain fucking forest.","Ok essentials for a 7 mile hike with my wife and my infant son and my dog:\n\n1 lb Keto friendly beef jerky \nTwo phones + work phone \nBattery bank\n360 selfie cam\nMirror less camera\nDrone\nAt least two of r/flashlight most recommended list\nSecond battery bank\nWifeys home made protein agave date brownies\nwork issue MacBook\n\nAnything else I might need?\n\nO ya about two sips of water.","I went on a hike today in central pa like 15 miles from the Capitol building and I ran out of service like a mile in.","Honestly, as much as you can carry. But realistically if it's that hot out you should not be out there. It's just not safe or enjoyable really. Go early in the morning, like 4am to 10am or go at night if you must hike. Night hiking in the desert with a good headlamp is a neat experience actually.","Hiking these trails is absolute insanity. Easier ways to both exercise and die folks!","This is how little time you have from when you see the water on the ground to nearly dying. What makes it so dangerous is the water runoff could be from 50 miles away, so you could look up and see blue skies but not know you are in danger.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7WnkgjhM0","How about BRING SOME WATER.  I bring 2 liters usually then kind bars and banana or apple","Bit of an old post but - I grew up in NJ and PA, lived in Houston for a few years - all places that are fairly humid. In Texas I'd go bike riding in 90+ degree heat during the day with one water bottle for \\~2 hours and have no problems, though I'd also chug some water beforehand. \n\nBack in 2020 I took a road trip up to the mountain states to do some bike riding in late October. During my stop in Salt Lake City it was like 65F and sunny, and I thought my usual one bottle of water would be more than enough. \n\nWell I had drunk that entire bottle about 30 mins in, and after an hour I felt more thirsty than I ever have in my life. I could not believe how quickly that dry air sucks the water out of you. Also my lips got chapped as fuck during the trip despite constant application of lip balm. That dry air is vicious. I cannot comprehend what that guy was thinking with half a gallon of water even if it did stay 70F.","It sounds like drowning because they live below sea level and like good Calvinists are subconsciously willing their own demise.","try not to get kidnapped as a 6 year old with a giant rack. It\u2019s just impractical from a surviving standpoint.","I\u2019ve been on many family trips and no it\u2019s not normal unless you\u2019re batshit insane maybe",],

text: ["I\u2019ve been meaning to ask why do English like throwing in a \u201czza\u201d to every nickname ? Is there \nlike a linguistic reason or is it a bit that got out of hand and everyone just kinda does it now to avoid looking silly ?","You're opinion is correct. It's one of the four romantic languages (derived from vulgar latin).\n\nGod bless pub quizzes.","I met guys (and girls) who did this during my travels in Asia. They would repeat the same twelve phrases really fast and confidently so it sort of seemed like they spoke the language. It was really retarded and embarrassing to watch.","He only fluently speaks a few languages he doesn\u2019t claim he learns an entire language in a week, he says he learns common conversational phrases that allow him to have basic interactions with people like buying things","I started french night school here in Quebec this week. Can assure you there is loads of them. Half the class was Mexican. Nice people, we should bring in more.","How many languages do you speak?","English and a tiny bit of French enough to order at a restaurant and ask my great granny if i could watch television and shit . French not as bad as all the other foreign languages once you get to know a little bit. It especially makes sense on paper no characters or fake letters. Trippy pronouns and apostrophes but altogether decent","If you speak more than one language y r u \u201chating from outside the club \u201c ?","Yeah French is really not that hard to read. I took French in college 10 years ago and can basically make my way through most newspaper articles. The english language is like 1/3 French loan words.","actually kind of a cool thing - it was explained to me that by doing weird letter and sometimes number combos & having a pronunciation legend, it allows people who've never spoken the language to learn it more easily on their own, which is great for language revitalization. there are usually accents and apostrophes indicating stress and glottal stops too, it's pretty neat.","it's just network effect -- english is the western language with the largest number of native speakers. also, english is a relatively easy language, especially for german speakers (which account for another 100M).","Bobby you got a C in English? But you speak English","this is fine when you're an adult but not when you're a child still learning the fundamentals of english","Can tell you copied that off Wikipedia because the accented \u0438 is only done there to relay where the emphasis is, it's not used in actual writing","yeah, one of the few things christian homeschooling got right was phonetics. although they are boring as hell at this point because poetry doesn't exist anymore",],

text: ["Oh I\u2019ve tried, but these vids are pervasive and make their way through the filters. You can block each creator individually, but there are thousands of them.","I knew it was over when I had to append \"reddit\" to the end of every search to get anything remotely helpful","So much AI written garbage at the top these days. I\u2019m on duck duck go but they\u2019ve got the same issue.","yandex is the best for reverse image searching (bing close 2nd) (google does not rank)","To get even more precise results you can add \"site:reddit.com*/r/SUBREDDIT*\" in your query to get exclusively results from this website.\n\nAdding the \"/r/subreddit\" part is optional of course but it works much better than using reddit's own search engine if you want to browse a sub.","Everything I Google gets one of two suffixes to it, wiki or Reddit. The optimist in me keeps forgetting to put those, and wastes 2-3 minutes total every day.","Some of them are more obvious than others. If I search \"best chefs knife\", [this](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/cooking-tools/best-kitchen-knives/g646/best-kitchen-cutlery/) is one of the top ones and has some stuff (like the \"```[product-summary-view][/product-summary-view]```\" text) that makes it look at least algorithmically generated and then human approved.\n\nI think that a lot of them are generated based on ad funding or general popularity and then an AI generates a list that a human does a quick pass at making look like a real list, and it gets published with referral links and a ton of SEO.","I've found them still working on DuckDuckGo, but maybe I was just seeing a placebo effect.","No burn intended homes, I meant the search commands literally don't work like they used to. You're searching a very very small puddle. It's fruitless.\n\n...n e way, peace and remember google is E.V.I.L.","Unfortunately Reddit purposefully kneecapped Google search \n\nIf you try to search something more likely than not you\u2019ll get stale results, from years ago due to how the new mobile Reddit functions \n\nMy theory is Reddit does this on purpose to avoid being quora. Basically if you find the answer easily then you won\u2019t make a thread asking the same fucking question and they\u2019ll lose traffic","Usually most of the words in my search are simply ignored.","oh my god youtube search is so atrocious. you just get the same videos over and over with clickbait titles. Google knows i am an adult and when i look for art tutorials i dont want things for 2 years old (google must know that based on the data they  have) but they still keep on serving me art tutorials for toddlers","i have like 50 different watch lists of different categories, cause the search is pointless","From googling about 5000 similar \u201chow do dog flea ointments work?\u201d questions, i would add on a \u201cmechanism of action\u201d term, if google still honored the quotations operator. I\u2019ll also usually add \u201cwiki\u201d to any search where i need real information but somehow forgot google was a bad place to search for anything you can\u2019t buy.","Youtube sort by oldest was so useful - we are going to miss it so much.",">Similar vein, notice how Google's Reverse Image function is  absolute bullshit now? It used to be actually useful.\n\nThis is the most blatant degradation. You can go on Yandex and get better results 99% of the time (although a lot of the results will be eastern European). I am quite certain that Google intentionally gimped their algorithm.","It's impossible to find small, obscure videos on YouTube anymore. I tried finding a decade old nostalgic video with only a few hundred views and it was hopeless because the search result just brings up the most popular trendy videos, and there are no options to refine the search.","I use Brave search and it's decent(also the browser is all I use now; built in ad block on phone is *chef's kiss*. Image search is just OK but normal search seems to be where g**gle was at ten years ago, that is, good.","Using yandex.com is a lot less curated.  The problem is since it's russian it sometimes won't have the best results or look through more of the Russian side of the internet. \n\nReverse image search was also killed by Google and Bing, I dont understand what the point of this Lens thing is.  Even clicking \"Find source image\" it just refuses to actually do the original purpose of image search.","Yandex works well when it works but often it will start showing similar images instead of the exact same image even for some common images that shouldn't be hard to find.  \n\nBut its not like there's any other choice anymore.   Bing and Google just refuses to even search for the image source most of the time when previously it worked very well.","You can also add `site:en.wikipedia.org`","It\u2019s all like \u201cVogue/Insider top 10 [vaguely the thing you were searching for]!\u201d but you know it\u2019ll be bias, sponsored, useless information","You used to be able to type in obscure song lyrics, and the answer you were looking for would pop up somewhere in the first 2 pages. Used to work just by approximating the beat too, but those kind of searches rarely work anymore.","They get a lot of their results from Bing, that's the issue\n\nhttps://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/results/sources/","they have youtube playlists for that now",],
